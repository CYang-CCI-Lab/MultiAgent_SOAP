Differential for underlying alkalosis includes pulmonary edema, PE, PNA, anemia, anxiety-hyperventilation, sepsis. Given a history of diarrhea, the patient may also have had a component of metabolic alkalosis. - Treat underlying pulmonary edema as detailed above - Consider treating anxiety PRN with low dose benzos PRN - Maintain Hct>30 given cardiac history -  ABG - Consider V/Q scan given pt with ""allergy"" to IV dye. . # Tachycardia: ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been 110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Of note the patient appeared to bumped troponins from 0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, thus likely stess induced.
