the left atrium is moderately dilated. the right atrium is moderately
dilated. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left
ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. there is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
akinesis. there is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (lvef <20%). the estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0l/min/m2). no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
the right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. there is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, as
well as a conduction abnormality or rv apical pacing. the aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there is at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
underestimated given severity of tr. there is no pericardial effusion.
impression: dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global
systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior myocardial
infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel cad). markedly
dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. mild
aortic regurgitation. moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
depressed cardiac index and at least mild pulmonary hypertension.
cxr: ett balloon hyperinflated. low lung volumes, with possible mild
vascular congestion. moderate cardiomegaly.

te: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef =
20-25 %). [intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial
effusion.
compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. the degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. the degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. lv systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.

perihilar opacity, worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely

the left atrium is mildly dilated. the right atrium is moderately
dilated. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left
ventricular cavity size is normal. overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (lvef>55%). right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. there is no valvular
aortic stenosis. the increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is no
pericardial effusion.

- the final ct abd/pelvis showd a multiseptated cystic lesion in the
tail of the pancreas, given appearance without associated duct dilation
would favor serous cystic pancreatic tumor or ipmn.  recommend
comparison with priors if available or endoscopic ultrasound.  tumor
markers were ordered for the am.
- ct also showed mild left uretral enhancement with surrounding
inflammatory change, which could represent ureteritis. recommend
followup ureteroscopy after appropriate treatement
- the patient continued to require levophed, it was weaned down,
however her sbps were in the 80's.  she briefly responded to a 500 cc
bolus of fluid, however she looked volume overloaded, so her levophed
was increased instead of more fluids for pressure support.
- repeat lactates were down from 3.6 --> 2.0 --> 1.0.
- vbg checked and was 7.30/48/41/25 in the am; repeat in the evening
