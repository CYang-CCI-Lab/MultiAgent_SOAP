17,"Question
In patients with opioid use disorder, what is the relative efficacy of buprenorphine and methadone maintenance therapy?
Review scope
Included studies compared buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT), >1 mg/day, with methadone maintenance therapy (MMT), >=20 mg/day, or placebo (including 1 mg/day of buprenorphine) in patients who were dependent on heroin or other opioids. Studies of pregnant women and those assessing buprenorphine or methadone for detoxification but with no maintenance phase were excluded. Outcomes included treatment retention and urinalysis-confirmed use of morphine, cocaine, and benzodiazepines.
Review methods
MEDLINE and EMBASE/Excerpta Medica (2003 to Jan 2013), Cochrane Central and Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 1), PsycLIT, Current Contents, several other databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and other electronic sources of ongoing trials, conference proceedings, Library of Congress databases, national focal points for drug research, and reference lists were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Authors were consulted. 31 RCTs (n=5430), ranging in size from 40 to 736 patients, met the selection criteria. Duration of study interventions ranged from 2 weeks to 52 weeks. 20 trials compared BMT with MMT, and 11 compared BMT with placebo.
Main results
As shown in the table below, low-, medium-, and high-dose BMT increased treatment retention more than placebo; BMT did not differ from equivalent doses of MMT for retention or had lower retention.
High-dose (standard mean difference -1.17, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.49), but not medium- or low-dose, BMT decreased morphine use more than placebo. Medium- and flexible-dose BMT and MMT did not differ for morphine use or cocaine use. BMT vs MMT and high-dose BMT vs placebo did not differ for benzodiazepine use.

A 38-year-old woman comes to the clinic for follow-up examination. She has opioid use disorder and currently takes methadone 40 mg daily as maintenance therapy.

In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, how do endoscopic sclerotherapy and emergency portacaval shunt compare for control of bleeding and survival?  
Methods  
Design: Randomized controlled trial (San Diego Bleeding Esophageal Varices Study). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  
Allocation: Concealed.  
Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  
Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.  
Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  
Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  
Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  
Outcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  
Main results 
15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4). Other main results are shown in the Table.
