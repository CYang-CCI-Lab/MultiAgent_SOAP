1,"Serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations are measured in blood samples collected from 25 healthy volunteers. The data follow a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation for this group are 130 mg/dL and 25 mg/dL, respectively. The standard error of the mean is 5.0. With a 95% confidence level, the true mean for the population from which this sample was drawn falls within which of the following ranges (in mg/dL)?","A: 105-155, B: 120-140, C: 125-135, D: 128-132, E: 129-131",B,1,B,"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given data step by step:\n1. **Given Data**: The sample consists of 25 healthy volunteers with serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations following a normal distribution. The mean (xÌ„) is 130 mg/dL, the standard deviation (s) is 25 mg/dL, and the standard error of the mean (SEM) is 5.0 mg/dL.""s,"","","","
2,"A 48-year-old man dies suddenly of a cardiac arrhythmia. Six weeks ago, he was resuscitated from a cardiac arrest caused by coronary artery disease and developed oliguric renal failure. Five weeks ago (1 week after being resuscitated), his serum urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration was 40 mg/dL, his serum creatinine concentration was 3.5 mg/dL, and his urine contained granular casts. Four weeks ago, his oliguria resolved, and his BUN and serum creatinine concentrations returned to normal. Examination of his kidneys at autopsy is most likely to show which of the following?","A. Acute inflammation, B. Fibrinous exudate, C. Fibrous scar, D. Granulation tissue, E. Normal kidney",E,2,E,"To determine the most likely finding on examination of the kidneys at autopsy, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n1. **Patient's History**: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to coronary artery disease, which led to oliguric renal failure. This indicates that the renal failure was likely caused by acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia during the cardiac arrest.\n2. **Laboratory Results**: The patient's serum urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration was 40 mg/dL, and his serum creatinine concentration was 3.5 mg/dL one week after the cardiac arrest. These elevated levels are consistent with impaired renal function. The presence of granular casts in the urine supports the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), a common cause of AKI.\n3. **Recovery of Renal Function**: Four weeks after the initial insult, the patient's oliguria resolved, and his BUN and serum creatinine concentrations returned to normal. This suggests that the acute kidney injury was reversible and that the kidneys had recovered from the injury.\n4. **Expected Autopsy Findings**: Given that the patient's renal function had returned to normal, we need to consider what the kidneys would look like at autopsy after such an injury and recovery.\n    - **Acute Inflammation (A)**: This would be expected in the early stages of AKI but would likely have resolved by the time of autopsy, given the timeframe of several weeks since the injury.\n    - **Fibrinous Exudate (B)**: This is not typically a dominant feature in the recovery phase of ATN.\n    - **Fibrous Scar (C)**: While some degree of fibrosis might occur after ATN, it is less likely to be the dominant finding in a case where renal function has fully recovered.\n    - **Granulation Tissue (D)**: This is a feature of the repair phase after tissue injury but would not be the expected dominant finding several weeks after the injury, especially with full recovery of renal function.\n    - **Normal Kidney (E)**: Given the recovery of renal function and the timeframe since the injury, the most likely finding would be a kidney that appears normal. The kidneys have a significant capacity for recovery after acute injury, and once the underlying cause is resolved, they can return to normal function and appearance.\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the most logical conclusion is that the kidneys would appear normal at autopsy, given the patient's full recovery from the acute kidney injury."
3,"In a sample of 100 individuals, the mean leukocyte count is 7500/mm3, with a standard deviation of 1000/mm3. If the leukocyte counts in this population follow a normal (gaussian) distribution, approximately 50% of individuals will have which of the following total leukocyte counts?","A: 5500-9500/mm3, B: <6500/mm3 or >8500/mm3, C: 6500-8500/mm3, D: <7500/mm3, E: >9500/mm3",D,3,C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of normal distribution and how to calculate the range that includes a certain percentage of the data. The question asks for the range that includes approximately 50% of the individuals, given a mean leukocyte count of 7500/mm3 and a standard deviation of 1000/mm3.\nStep 1: Understand the normal distribution and the 68-95-99.7 rule. This rule states that about 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within 2 standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations.\nStep 2: Recognize that the question asks for the range that includes approximately 50% of the individuals. In a normal distribution, about 50% of the data falls within approximately 0.675 standard deviations of the mean.\nStep 3: Calculate the range that includes approximately 50% of the data. However, given the options provided, we can look for the range that is closest to including 50% of the data, which would be within 1 standard deviation of the mean, including about 68% of the data.\nStep 4: Calculate the range within 1 standard deviation of the mean. One standard deviation above the mean is 7500 + 1000 = 8500/mm3, and one standard deviation below the mean is 7500 - 1000 = 6500/mm3.\nStep 5: Identify the correct answer choice based on the calculations and understanding of the normal distribution. The range 6500-8500/mm3 includes about 68% of the data, which is the closest to the 50% mark among the provided options."", "
