Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'.

It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Specimen #: Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; in the sample. provided for analysis. Fewer than %5 of non-small-cell lung. carcinoma patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for. this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 50% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in th vrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor recept. gene are reported to be associated with. differenti. ness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitr.

METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis.

Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A frozen section of the nodule. 1B-1D remaining of the nodule. 1E random section of the lung parenchyma. 1F staple line margin. 2A in toto. 3A soft tissue submitted, shaved. 4A in toto. 5A in toto. 6A in toto. 7A bronchial margin, shaved. 7B vascular margin, shaved. 7C-7H mass from stitch area with overlying pleura. 7I-7L mass from stitch area after shaving the staple line. 7M anthracotic lymph node from the hilum. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.
