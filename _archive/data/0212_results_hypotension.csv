TE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20-25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. The degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. The degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. LV systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.
CXR: Improved pulmonary edema which is now mild with stable left
perihilar opacity, worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely
consolidation, probably pneumonia,less likely asymmetrical pulmonary
edema.","sepsis ; altered/depressed m thought to be [ * * 1-25 * * ] to ativan yesterday , ; # acute on chronic renal failure ; supertherapeutic inr ; afib , now rate control - likely worsen by underlie sepsis ; s/p biv placement [ * * 8-31 * * ] . ; demand ischemia","Sepsis; Altered/Depressed Mental Status thought to be [**1-25**] to ativan yesterday,; # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure; supertherapeutic International Normalized Ratio; Atrial fibrillation, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying sepsis; status post Biventricular placement [**8-31**].; demand ischemia",Depressed Mood;Sepsis;Demand ischemia;sepsis;Acute on Chronic Right Heart Failure,acute on chronic renal failure;Demand ischemia;afib;depressed;sepsis,Altered Mental Status;Sepsis;Demand ischemia;alternation;Biventricular failure;Atrial fibrillation;sepsis;Acute on Chronic Right Heart Failure,sepsis; altered depressed mental status thought to be to ativan yesterday ; acute on chronic renal failure; supertherapeutic international normalized ratio; atrial fibrillation now rate controlled likely worsened by underlying sepsis; status post biventricular placement ; demand ischemia,"['sepsis', 'altered depressed mental status thought to be to ativan yesterday', 'acute on chronic renal failure', 'supertherapeutic international normalized ratio', 'atrial fibrillation now rate controlled likely worsened by underlying sepsis', 'status post biventricular placement', 'demand ischemia']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"To determine if the patient is diagnosed with hypotension, we need to analyze the provided subjective and objective data.

Looking at the objective data, the patient's blood pressure is listed as 102/68 mmHg, with a range of {89/31(46) - 119/68(74)} mmHg. Although the patient's blood pressure does dip to 89/31 mmHg at some point, the current reading and the majority of the range provided are not indicative of hypotension. Furthermore, the patient is receiving fluid boluses, which suggests efforts to maintain or improve blood pressure, but the current blood pressure readings do not fall into the hypotensive range for the majority of the observations. The patient's condition, including severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and significant valvular issues, could predispose to hypotension, but based on the provided blood pressure readings, the patient does not currently meet the criteria for hypotension at the time of this assessment.",True,"To diagnose hypotension, we need to analyze the patient's blood pressure readings and other relevant information from the provided report. The patient's blood pressure is listed as 102/68(74) mmHg with a range of {89/31(46) - 119/68(74)} mmHg. The low blood pressure reading of 89/31(46) mmHg indicates potential hypotension. Additionally, the patient is on various medications, including antibiotics and vasodilators, which can contribute to hypotension. The echocardiogram results show severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, which can also lead to hypotension due to decreased cardiac output. Furthermore, the patient has a history of fluid bolus and changes in medication, which may be related to managing hypotension. Considering these factors, it appears that the patient is experiencing hypotension. "

Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is typically defined as a blood pressure reading below 90/60 mmHg. The patient's report provides blood pressure readings, which are crucial for this diagnosis. In the Objective section, the patient's blood pressure is listed as 150/50(77) {129/47(77) - 213/151(159)} mmHg. The key figure here for diagnosing hypotension is the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number), but more importantly, the overall blood pressure reading and its implications on the patient's health. Given that the lowest systolic blood pressure mentioned is 129 mmHg and the lowest diastolic is 47 mmHg, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 77 mmHg, we need to consider if these values indicate hypotension. However, the provided blood pressure readings do not consistently fall below the threshold for hypotension, especially considering the systolic values. Furthermore, the presence of a high-grade AV nodal block and the recent implantation of a VDD pacemaker via axillary access, along with episodes of chest pain, suggest that the patient's condition is complex and involves cardiovascular issues, but the blood pressure readings themselves do not clearly indicate hypotension. Therefore, based on the blood pressure readings provided, the patient does not have a clear diagnosis of hypotension.",True,"To determine if the patient is diagnosed with hypotension, we need to analyze the provided patient report in the context of the long-term memory about hypotension. The patient report includes both subjective and objective information. From the subjective section, we note that the patient had a recent procedure (VDD implant) with significant bleeding, a high-grade AV nodal block, and episodes of chest pain. The objective section provides vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings. Key points include a blood pressure reading of 150/50 mmHg, which indicates hypotension given the low diastolic value, a heart rate of 62 bpm, and various laboratory results such as low hemoglobin (9.3 g/dL) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, which could suggest blood loss or anemia. The presence of diffuse wheezing, bradycardia, and the patient's recent medical history are also relevant. Considering the long-term memory, several points are pertinent: hypotension can be associated with recent procedures, especially those involving bleeding; low hematocrit levels over time can indicate blood loss contributing to hypotension; medications and certain medical conditions can cause hypotension; and laboratory findings such as low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels can be indicative of hypotension. Given these considerations, the patient's low diastolic blood pressure, recent bleeding during a procedure, and laboratory evidence of potential anemia or blood loss support the diagnosis of hypotension."
