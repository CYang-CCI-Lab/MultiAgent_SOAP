te: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef =
20-25 %). [intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial
effusion.
compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. the degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. the degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. lv systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.

The patient's urine output is 680 ml over 24 hours, which is relatively low and may suggest oliguria, a common symptom of acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 2,033 ml, which could be contributing to the kidney injury. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.17, which is low and suggests that the patient's kidneys are trying to retain sodium, a common response to prerenal azotemia or acute kidney injury. However, without more information on the patient's baseline kidney function and the trend of their creatinine levels over time, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, the combination of low urine output, positive fluid balance, and fluctuating creatinine levels suggests that acute kidney injury is a likely diagnosis."

   .",True,"The patient's serum creatinine (cr) level is 0.8 mg/dl, which is within the normal range for many labs, suggesting that acute kidney injury may not be present based solely on this metric. However, the presence of sulfonamides in the patient's history could be a risk factor for kidney injury, as some sulfonamides are known to be nephrotoxic. The patient is also on other medications such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, which have potential nephrotoxic effects but are not as commonly associated with acute kidney injury as some other antibiotics. The urine output over 24 hours is 274 ml and 310 ml, which is lower than the typical normal range (usually considered >400-500 ml per 24 hours for adults), suggesting possible oliguria, a symptom of acute kidney injury. Given the low urine output and the potential nephrotoxic effects of some medications, despite the normal creatinine level, there is a suggestion of acute kidney injury. However, without more direct evidence such as a rising creatinine trend or more severe oliguria/anuria, the diagnosis is not definitive. Considering the information provided, the most likely conclusion leans towards the possibility of acute kidney injury due to the low urine output and potential nephrotoxic medication effects, but it is not conclusively proven."

   .",True,"The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level (1.6 and 1.7 mg/dl), which is a key indicator of acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient has a low urine output (425 ml and 710 ml), which is another important criterion for diagnosing acute kidney injury. The patient's vital signs, such as tachycardia (hr: 113 bpm) and low blood pressure (bp: 124/60 mmHg), may also be indicative of hypovolemia or shock, which can contribute to acute kidney injury. However, the patient has received a significant amount of fluid (total in: 2,641 ml) and blood products (750 ml), which may have affected the urine output. Despite this, the elevated creatinine level and low urine output suggest that the patient is likely experiencing acute kidney injury. Furthermore, the patient's clinical context, including recent surgery, transfusions, and use of potentially nephrotoxic medications like metronidazole, increases the risk of acute kidney injury."

   .",True,"The patient's recent dialysis, coffee ground material from the NGT after epistaxis, and removal of the Dobhoff tube suggest a complex clinical scenario. However, the key indicators for acute kidney injury (AKI) include the patient's recent need for dialysis and the laboratory values, particularly the creatinine (Cr) levels. The Cr level is reported as 9.0 and 8.5 mg/dL, which are significantly elevated and indicate impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, which could be a result of or a contributing factor to AKI. The presence of sclera icteric and jaundiced skin may also suggest liver dysfunction, which can be associated with AKI in the context of multi-organ failure. Given these findings, the evidence strongly suggests acute kidney injury."

Nonetheless, the low urine output is a critical clue that warrants further investigation for AKI. Given the information available, the most likely conclusion leans towards the possibility of acute kidney injury due to the significantly reduced urine output, despite the lack of clear elevation in serum creatinine levels at this point."

Additionally, the patient has a low urine output (49 ml and 16 ml), which further supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. The patient's use of certain medications such as vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, which are known nephrotoxins, also increases the risk of acute kidney injury. The presence of other laboratory abnormalities such as elevated lactic acid (6.3 mmol/l) and low albumin (2.5 g/dl) may also be related to acute kidney injury. While the patient's vital signs and other laboratory results show some abnormalities, the combination of elevated creatinine, low urine output, and use of nephrotoxic medications provides strong evidence for acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient is receiving potential nephrotoxic medications such as vancomycin and furosemide (Lasix), which can contribute to kidney injury. The patient's urine output is 1,074 ml over 24 hours, which is relatively low and may indicate oliguria, a common symptom of acute kidney injury. However, the patient's fluid balance is slightly negative (-181 ml), which could be a factor in the low urine output. Despite this, the elevated creatinine levels and potential nephrotoxic medication use suggest that acute kidney injury is likely. Furthermore, the patient's other lab values, such as the white blood cell count (WBC) and glucose, are not directly indicative of acute kidney injury but do suggest a possible underlying infection or stress response, which could be contributing to the kidney injury."

Recent laboratory values show fluctuations in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, but specific markers of kidney function such as serum creatinine are not provided. However, the patient received furosemide (Lasix) for hyperkalemia, indicating potential issues with potassium levels, which can be associated with kidney dysfunction. Additionally, the patient's complex medical history, including diabetes with nephropathy and the use of medications like mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, which can have nephrotoxic effects, further supports the concern for AKI. Despite the lack of explicit serum creatinine values or urine output data that directly points to AKI, the overall clinical context suggests a high risk for acute kidney injury, especially given the recent gastrointestinal bleeding, potential for hypovolemia, and the administration of nephrotoxic agents. Thus, while not definitive without more specific renal function data, the clinical scenario leans towards the possibility of acute kidney injury due to the combination of risk factors and the patient's underlying health conditions."

   on chronic renal failure.",True,"The patient presents with bilateral flank pain, obstructing ureteral stones, leukocytosis, fever, and acute on chronic renal failure, which are all relevant clues that align with acute kidney injury. The presence of obstructing ureteral stones can cause post-renal acute kidney injury due to the obstruction of urine flow. Additionally, the patient's elevated creatinine level (4.0 mg/dl) and acute on chronic renal failure as mentioned in the subjective section further support the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, including the elevated white blood cell count (22.3 k/ul) and the presence of fever, also suggest an infectious or inflammatory process that could be contributing to the acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is not explicitly stated, but the presence of an indwelling Foley catheter and the mention of a 'bag draining small amount of bloody fluid' may indicate some degree of oliguria or urine concentration issues, which are common in acute kidney injury. Overall, the combination of clinical and laboratory findings strongly suggests the presence of acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient's urine output is relatively low at 204 ml, which could suggest decreased renal function. However, the patient is also receiving fluids and has a positive fluid balance, which could affect urine output. Despite this, the rising creatinine levels and low urine output in the context of critical illness and the use of potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics like vancomycin and meropenem, suggest that acute kidney injury is likely. The patient's clinical context, including the use of these medications and the presence of other organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation), further supports this diagnosis."

Additionally, the patient's creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dl, but without a baseline, it's difficult to assess for an increase. However, the presence of 1+ RBC and WBC in the urine analysis, along with 1 granular cast, indicates kidney damage or disease. The patient is also on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, which can be nephrotoxic. Given these clues, acute kidney injury is a possible diagnosis, but the evidence is not definitive without more information on the patient's baseline kidney function and the trend of their creatinine levels."

Additionally, the patient received furosemide (Lasix) to achieve goal diuresis, suggesting an attempt to manage fluid overload, a common complication of acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is 3,095 ml, which may indicate adequate diuresis, but the overall fluid balance is negative (-2,235 ml), which could be a sign of dehydration or inadequate fluid resuscitation. The presence of contraction alkalosis and hypokalemia, for which the patient received potassium chloride (KCl), is also consistent with the use of loop diuretics like furosemide, which can contribute to kidney injury. While the patient's clinical presentation is complex, with agitation, altered mental status, and infection (GPC in clusters), the laboratory evidence and the use of diuretics to manage fluid status suggest that acute kidney injury is likely. Therefore, based on the available information, the diagnosis of acute kidney injury is considered true."

However, without a baseline creatinine level for comparison, it's difficult to determine if this represents an acute increase. The patient's urine output over 24 hours is 150 ml and 328 ml, which totals 478 ml, indicating oliguria, a common sign of acute kidney injury. The patient is also on medications such as ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim), which can affect kidney function. Given the oliguria and the potential nephrotoxic effects of certain medications, there is a suggestion of acute kidney injury, but the diagnosis would be more definitive with additional information such as a baseline creatinine level, more detailed urine output records, and possibly imaging or other diagnostic tests. Nonetheless, based on the provided information, particularly the low urine output, it seems there is enough evidence to lean towards the presence of acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient is receiving furosemide (lasix), a diuretic that can be used to manage fluid overload, a common complication of acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is 1,200 ml over 24 hours, which is relatively low and may indicate decreased renal function. The presence of nausea/vomiting, which can be a symptom of uremia, and the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors and spironolactone, which can affect renal function, further support the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. While the patient's vital signs and other laboratory results are not entirely normal, the combination of elevated creatinine levels, low urine output, and relevant medication use suggests that acute kidney injury is likely."

The objective section reveals a relatively stable creatinine level (1.4 mg/dl) over time, but this does not necessarily rule out AKI, especially given the patient's fluid balance and the use of diuretics like lasix and metolazone, which can affect urine output and mask underlying kidney dysfunction. However, the patient did respond to diuretic therapy with increased urine output, which could indicate some preserved renal function. The presence of hypotension and the need for significant fluid resuscitation could also contribute to or exacerbate AKI. Given these factors, while there are indications of potential renal stress or injury, the direct evidence for acute kidney injury (such as a rising creatinine level or a more detailed urine analysis) is not conclusively presented. Nonetheless, the clinical context (use of diuretics, fluid balance, and overall patient condition) suggests that AKI should be considered and closely monitored."

However, the key laboratory findings that support or refute AKI are crucial. The patient's creatinine (cr) level is elevated at 10.5 mg/dl, which is a significant indicator of renal dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has a high glucose level (124 mg/dl) and alterations in electrolyte levels, which can be associated with AKI. The presence of a dialysis catheter also implies that the patient is either at risk of or is experiencing renal failure, necessitating dialysis. While the urine output is not explicitly stated in a quantitative manner, the fact that there is a mention of 'urine' under the 'total out' section without a specified volume could imply oliguria, a common symptom of AKI.

Additionally, the patient's creatinine (cr) levels are 1.3 and 1.2 mg/dl, which, although not drastically elevated, indicate some degree of renal impairment when considered in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and the marginal urine output. The presence of dark urine, as noted in the genitourinary (gu) examination, further supports the possibility of concentrated urine, which can be seen in acute kidney injury due to decreased renal function. While the patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic parameters are being closely monitored and managed, the combination of oliguria, elevated creatinine levels, and dark urine provides evidence that aligns with acute kidney injury. Therefore, despite the absence of drastically elevated creatinine levels or more severe oliguria, the cumulative evidence suggests that acute kidney injury is likely present."

   Rehab for respiratory distress.",True,"The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results provide clues that suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix), a diuretic often used in the management of fluid overload, which can be a complication of AKI. Additionally, the patient's urine output is 260 ml over 24 hours, which is lower than the typical normal urine output of approximately 1.5 to 2 liters per day, indicating possible oliguria, a hallmark of AKI. However, without explicit serum creatinine values or a clear indication of a rise in creatinine levels over time, the diagnosis relies on the clinical context and the presence of oliguria. The patient's overall critical condition, including the need for mechanical ventilation and the administration of dopamine, suggests a complex clinical picture with potential multi-organ involvement, including the kidneys. Given the information available, while there are indicators suggestive of AKI, such as reduced urine output and the use of diuretics, the absence of explicit creatinine levels or more detailed renal function tests introduces some uncertainty. Nonetheless, the clinical context and the presence of oliguria lean towards the possibility of AKI."

   .",True,"The patient's urine output is 160 ml in the last 24 hours (1,560 ml), which is a significant indicator of acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient received IV lasix with an excellent urine output, suggesting some responsiveness to diuretics but also indicating a need for such intervention. The serum creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 1.0 mg/dl, which, although a small increase, could be significant in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture, including the low urine output and the use of diuretics. Other lab values such as elevated glucose, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and electrolyte imbalances could be related to or exacerbated by acute kidney injury. However, the increase in creatinine is mild, and other factors such as the patient's fluid balance (-679 ml and -1,183 ml) and the presence of other organ dysfunctions (e.g., liver dysfunction indicated by elevated AST, ALT, and bilirubin) could influence the diagnosis. Despite these considerations, the combination of reduced urine output and the need for diuretic therapy, along with the mild increase in creatinine, leans towards the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

   hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension",True,"The patient's report indicates sepsis, the use of pressors (norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure, and a lack of diuresis despite low blood pressures, which are risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI). The objective section shows a serum creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dl, which, while not elevated, must be considered in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture, including the use of fluids and pressors. The urine output is 1,550 ml over 24 hours, which averages approximately 64.6 ml/hour, a value that is lower than the typical threshold for oliguria (which is < 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 12 hours) but may not be significantly low for a patient with sepsis and on pressors without knowing the patient's weight. However, the context of sepsis, the need for vasopressor support, and the fact that the patient did not diurese well initially suggest a predisposition to AKI. Given these factors, while the serum creatinine is not markedly elevated, the clinical context suggests that acute kidney injury could be present or developing, especially considering the complexities of fluid management and the potential for creatinine levels to lag behind the onset of kidney injury. Thus, leaning towards the presence of AKI given the clinical scenario and the potential for AKI in a septic patient with these characteristics."

The objective section shows a creatinine level of 4.9 mg/dl, which is elevated and indicates impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient has a low urine output of 35 ml and 120 ml, which is a sign of acute kidney injury. The presence of hepatomegaly and the need for hemodialysis further support this diagnosis. Although the patient's overall condition has improved, as evidenced by their alertness and interaction, the specific indicators of kidney function point towards acute kidney injury."

1.  pneumoperitoneum and  fluid accumulation adjacent to the second
part of
the duodenum, which extends into the right anterior pararenal spaces,
are
suggestive of perforation of ulcer of second part of duodenum.
2.  interval development of complete collapse of l4 lumbar vertebra and
interval decrease in the soft tissue mass of the pedicle of l4.  as no
iv
contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac compression cannot be
performed.
3.  diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
4. interval development of high density mass in right adrenal gland in
1 month
is suggestive of either benign etiologies such as hematoma or
metastatic
disease ( underlyng small cell lung cancer) .
impression:  no large amount of free intraperitoneal air identified.
if
clinical suspicion is high, decubitus film or standing upright film is
recommended.
findings:  in comparison with study of [**2161-3-15**], there is little
change in
the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
catheter,
or the pacemaker leads.  the hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
seen,
consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  mild
fullness
of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.
the somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
base
laterally is again seen.

The patient's serum creatinine levels have been monitored, showing values of 1.4 and 1.6 mg/dl, indicating some degree of renal impairment. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing tachycardia and edema, which could be related to fluid overload or acute kidney injury. However, the urine output is reported as 1196 ml over 24 hours, which, although not explicitly compared to a baseline, suggests that the patient is not anuric and has some level of renal function. The patient's lactate levels have improved with fluid resuscitation, which is a positive sign. Given the clinical context of severe illness, hypotension, and the need for fluid resuscitation, it is plausible that the patient could be at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), especially given the rise in creatinine levels. However, without more explicit information on the patient's baseline renal function, the diagnosis of AKI cannot be conclusively made based solely on the provided data. Nonetheless, the presence of risk factors and some indicators of renal impairment lean towards considering AKI as a potential diagnosis."

   unknown etiology.",True,"The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level is 0.7 mg/dl, which is within the normal range for many labs, although this can vary by lab and patient demographics. However, the presence of a low serum creatinine in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture, including significant comorbidities, use of potentially nephrotoxic medications (such as metronidazole and ciprofloxacin), and the patient's critical condition, does not strongly argue against acute kidney injury (AKI) since AKI can occur with normal or even decreased serum creatinine levels, especially in the early stages or in volume-depleted states. The patient's urine output is 825 ml over 24 hours, which averages out to approximately 34.4 ml/hour, suggesting oliguria, a key criterion for AKI. Additionally, the patient's hemodynamic instability (indicated by tachycardia, hypotension, and the need for vasopressors or inotropes, although not explicitly mentioned, the use of diltiazem for rate control in afib and metoprolol suggests some degree of hemodynamic support) and the presence of sepsis (indicated by the urine culture showing GNRs and the administration of antibiotics) are risk factors for AKI. Given these considerations, while the serum creatinine level alone does not confirm AKI, the combination of oliguria, critical illness, and exposure to nephrotoxic agents suggests that AKI should be considered and further evaluated with more specific criteria such as the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, which include changes in serum creatinine and urine output over time."

Additionally, the objective section shows elevated creatinine levels (cr: 5.2-6.2), low urine output (1,405 ml in 24 hours), and hyperkalemia (5.7 mg/dl), all of which are indicative of acute kidney injury. The patient's encephalopathic state and asterixis also support this diagnosis, as they can be associated with uremia. The presence of other potential causes of kidney injury, such as recent antibiotic use (piperacillin/tazobactam) and possible sepsis (indicated by elevated WBC and lactic acid), further supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

   .",True,"The patient's report indicates a need for a temporary HD (hemodialysis) catheter placement and plan for HD, suggesting renal impairment. The patient is also on norepinephrine, indicating potential hypotension, a common complication in acute kidney injury (AKI). Additionally, the patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels (cr: 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.3), which is a key indicator of kidney function decline. The presence of oliguria (low urine output: 110 ml in 24 hours) further supports the diagnosis of AKI. While the patient has other complications such as atrial fibrillation and potential sepsis (indicated by the use of vancomycin and cefipime), the specific mention of renal services and the need for hemodialysis, along with the laboratory evidence of declining kidney function, strongly suggests acute kidney injury."

However, the patient's urine output is 300 ml and 310 ml, which, although not explicitly compared to a baseline, does not immediately suggest oliguria (reduced urine output), a common sign of acute kidney injury. Despite this, the increase in creatinine levels and the use of potentially nephrotoxic medications provide strong evidence for acute kidney injury.

Additionally, the patient's urine output is 957 ml in 24 hours, and 449 ml in the last 12 hours (since 12 am), which is lower than expected, suggesting oliguria, a common symptom of acute kidney injury. The patient also received a 250cc bolus and was given diuresis on Lasix, but there was no response, further indicating a potential issue with kidney function. Other lab values such as elevated lactic acid and low albumin levels may also be associated with acute kidney injury. However, without more information on the patient's baseline kidney function and without knowing the exact urine output in relation to fluid intake, the diagnosis is not definitive. Nonetheless, the increasing creatinine levels and low urine output provide strong evidence for acute kidney injury."

   with evidence of cholangitis, confirmed by ERCP shortly after her
   arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].",True,"The patient underwent ERCP yesterday and received IV fluid boluses for a urine output of 20-30cc/h, which suggests possible acute kidney injury (AKI) due to contrast-induced nephropathy or hypovolemia. However, the patient's current urine output is 410 ml over 24 hours, which, although low, does not alone confirm AKI without knowing the baseline creatinine or more detailed urine output trends. The absence of specific kidney function tests (like serum creatinine) in the provided information makes it difficult to definitively diagnose AKI. Nonetheless, the clinical context (recent ERCP and low urine output prompting fluid boluses) raises suspicion for AKI. Given the information available and the context of recent procedures that could impact kidney function, it's reasonable to lean towards the possibility of AKI, but with the understanding that a definitive diagnosis would require more specific laboratory data, such as serum creatinine levels before and after the procedure."

Additionally, the patient has received furosemide (Lasix), a diuretic that can affect urine output and potentially worsen kidney function. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance (-735 ml and -270 ml), indicating potential hypovolemia, which can contribute to acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is not explicitly stated, but the presence of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and the need for respiratory support may indicate a critically ill state, increasing the risk of acute kidney injury. While the patient's hemodynamic parameters are relatively stable, the elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and the use of antibiotics suggest a potential infection, which can also contribute to acute kidney injury. Considering these factors, the evidence suggests that acute kidney injury is likely."

Additionally, the patient's urine output is 390 ml over 24 hours, which is lower than the typical normal range, further supporting the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. The patient is also on norepinephrine, which can be nephrotoxic, and has been switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn), which can also be nephrotoxic. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, which can be a risk factor for acute kidney injury. The on-call request for a temporary versus tunnelled HD line pending also suggests that the patient's renal function is a concern. Therefore, based on the laboratory results, medication use, and clinical context, the diagnosis of acute kidney injury is likely."

Additionally, the patient is on several medications that can affect kidney function, such as sulfonamides and furosemide (Lasix), a loop diuretic. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance (-804 ml), which could indicate dehydration and potentially worsen kidney function. The patient's urine output is not explicitly stated, but the presence of furosemide suggests an attempt to manage fluid overload, which can be a complication of acute kidney injury.

The placement of a femoral hemodialysis (HD) line and the patient undergoing HD further supports the likelihood of AKI, as HD is a treatment for AKI when conservative management fails. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (ranging from 6.7 to 7.4), which is a key indicator of reduced kidney function and AKI. The patient's fluid balance and urine output are also relevant, with 612 ml of urine output in 24 hours, which may indicate oliguria, another criterion for AKI. While there are other significant clinical issues presented, such as bleeding from the HD site and concerns for ischemia, the evidence strongly supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient has a low urine output of 80 ml and 450 ml, which suggests oliguria, a common symptom of acute kidney injury. However, other labs such as the patient's electrolyte panel and lactic acid level do not show significant abnormalities that would strongly suggest acute kidney injury. Despite this, the elevated creatinine levels and low urine output provide sufficient evidence to support the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

   recent rx for MRSA septic joint who is now admitted to the ICU with
   hypotension following fusion of his left knee on [**2155-8-30**].",True,"The patient's presentation includes several indicators suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI), such as a significant increase in creatinine levels (from an unspecified baseline to 2.2 and then 2.5 mg/dL), which is a key marker for AKI. Additionally, the patient has received a substantial amount of fluid resuscitation (9L crystalloid + 8U PRBCs) and has been on pressor support, indicating hypotension, which can be both a cause and a consequence of AKI. The patient's urine output is notably low (30 mL), which is another critical criterion for diagnosing AKI. While the patient's complex clinical picture includes cardiac issues (indicated by the bump in cardiac enzymes and the need for pressor support), sepsis (suggested by the administration of antibiotics and the presence of hypotension), and possible abdominal issues (luq tenderness), the specific evidence of decreased urine output and rising creatinine levels strongly supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient's urine output is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be low given the context of fluid balance and the presence of a foley catheter. The patient's overall clinical picture, including the need for ICU admission and hemodynamic monitoring, further supports the likelihood of acute kidney injury. While the patient received large volumes of fluid, which could affect kidney function, the rise in creatinine levels suggests intrinsic renal damage or acute kidney injury rather than simple volume overload. The presence of other organ dysfunction (e.g., abnormal liver enzymes) and the patient's critical condition also align with the complex clinical scenario often seen in acute kidney injury."

Additionally, the patient received a 1L NS bolus for low urine output and lowish blood pressure, suggesting concerns about renal perfusion. The serum creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dl, but without baseline values, it's difficult to assess for an increase. However, the low urine output and the need for fluid boluses suggest that the patient may be experiencing some degree of renal impairment. The patient is also on medications that can affect kidney function, such as vancomycin and tobramycin. Given the low urine output and the clinical context, acute kidney injury is a likely diagnosis."

Additionally, the patient's urine output is relatively low (490 ml in 24 hours), suggesting oliguria, another criterion for acute kidney injury. The patient is also receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine and dobutamine, which can affect renal function. Furthermore, the patient's hemodynamic monitoring data, such as the low blood pressure (101/61 mmHg) and high heart rate (89 bpm), may indicate hypoperfusion, a potential cause of acute kidney injury. While the patient's overall clinical picture is complex, the combination of elevated creatinine, low urine output, and potential hypoperfusion suggests that acute kidney injury is likely present."

The creatinine level has increased to 2.8 mg/dl, indicating a decline in renal function. The presence of leukocytes, white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine suggests a possible infection. However, the absence of eosinophils in the urine makes acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) less likely. The patient's history of recent contrast exposure (3vd on cath) increases the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The low urine output and rising creatinine level, in conjunction with the recent contrast exposure, support the diagnosis of acute kidney injury, likely due to CIN. The patient's complex medical history, including heart failure and restrictive lung disease, may also contribute to the development of acute kidney injury. Therefore, based on the provided information, the diagnosis of acute kidney injury is likely."

Additionally, the patient has received medications such as vancomycin, which is known to be nephrotoxic, and has been in a state of hypotension (as indicated by the need for IV fluid boluses and vasopressor support), both of which can contribute to kidney injury. The presence of fluid overload, as suggested by the 1+ and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities and the elevated fluid balance, further supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. While the urine output is not explicitly stated as oliguric, the overall clinical picture, including the need for close monitoring of fluid status and the use of diuretics (not explicitly mentioned but potentially part of the 'other ICU medications'), suggests that renal function is compromised. Therefore, based on the rising creatinine levels, potential nephrotoxic medication exposure, and clinical context of fluid overload and potential hypoperfusion, acute kidney injury is likely."

Additionally, the patient has been dialyzed, suggesting that their kidney function is compromised. However, the patient's urine output is not explicitly stated as being oliguric, which is a common symptom of acute kidney injury. Despite this, the elevated creatinine levels and the need for dialysis suggest that the patient is experiencing acute kidney injury. Furthermore, the patient's overall clinical presentation, including their hemodynamic monitoring and vital signs, does not strongly argue against acute kidney injury. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is likely that the patient has acute kidney injury."

The key indicators for acute kidney injury (AKI) include the serum creatinine (Cr) levels, which have been relatively stable around 0.4-0.6 mg/dL, and the urine output, which is approximately 3,370 ml over 24 hours, suggesting some degree of renal function but possibly not adequate given the patient's fluid resuscitation and critical status. However, the presence of sepsis, hepatic failure, and the use of potentially nephrotoxic medications (e.g., vancomycin, meropenem) are risk factors for AKI. The patient's fluid balance and the use of diuretics like furosemide (Lasix) also impact renal function. Given the complexity of the patient's condition and the presence of risk factors for AKI, along with some indicators of possible renal impairment (though not definitively diagnostic), it's reasonable to consider AKI as a potential diagnosis. However, without a clear rise in creatinine or a more detailed assessment of urine output in relation to fluid intake, the diagnosis remains uncertain. Considering the critical nature of the patient's condition and the potential for AKI given the clinical context, it's prudent to lean towards the possibility of AKI, especially in a critically ill patient with multiple organ dysfunctions."

Additionally, the patient has a low urine output of 120 ml and 199 ml over 24 hours, which is a sign of oliguria, a common symptom of acute kidney injury. However, the patient is also receiving fluids and blood products, which may affect urine output. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a blood pressure of 110/41 mmHg, which is within a relatively normal range, but the low diastolic pressure could indicate hypoperfusion, a potential cause of acute kidney injury. The patient's troponin levels are rising, which may indicate cardiac injury, a potential cause of acute kidney injury. The patient's lab results also show an elevated glucose level, which could be a sign of stress or sepsis, another potential cause of acute kidney injury. Considering these factors, the evidence suggests that the patient may have acute kidney injury, but the diagnosis is not definitive without further information, such as the patient's baseline kidney function or more detailed urine output data. However, based on the available data, acute kidney injury is a likely diagnosis."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10381**] is a 76F with multiple medical problems, who is transferred
   to the MICU for further management of presumed sepsis",True,"The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level is 1.8 mg/dl, which is elevated and suggests impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient received boluses for low systolic blood pressure, which could indicate hypoperfusion and potential acute kidney injury. However, the urine output is 410 ml over 24 hours, which, although not explicitly indicating oliguria, is on the lower side and could be consistent with acute kidney injury in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture. Other lab values such as the elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and the presence of fever could indicate an infectious process, which might contribute to or be a consequence of acute kidney injury. Given these clues, there is evidence to suggest acute kidney injury, but the diagnosis would be more definitive with additional information such as a baseline creatinine level for comparison and more detailed urine output records. Nonetheless, based on the available data, acute kidney injury seems plausible."

In the subjective section, it's mentioned that the patient is 'too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time,' which implies consideration for renal replacement therapy due to kidney dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has been repeatedly repleted with potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium, which can be indicative of electrolyte imbalances often seen in AKI. The use of chlorothiazide for increased diuresis and concern for volume overload also points towards fluid management issues that can be associated with AKI. In the objective section, the patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels (Cr: 1.9, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0 mg/dL), which is a key indicator of reduced kidney function and a diagnostic criterion for AKI. The urine output is 1,128 ml over 24 hours, which, depending on the patient's fluid intake, could be considered oliguric, another criterion for AKI.

Additionally, the patient has a low albumin level (2.5 g/dl) and elevated lactic acid (1.2 mmol/l), which can be associated with kidney dysfunction. However, the patient's troponin-t level is slightly elevated (0.62), and the echocardiogram shows severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF = 20-25%), which may suggest cardiogenic shock as a potential cause of acute kidney injury. Despite the lack of subjective symptoms, the objective evidence of elevated creatinine and other laboratory abnormalities supports the diagnosis of acute kidney injury."

   who is transferred from OSH for NSTEMI and respiratory distress",True,"The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD), which already indicates compromised renal function. The current serum creatinine (Cr) level is 5.2 mg/dL, which is elevated and consistent with renal impairment. However, to diagnose acute kidney injury (AKI), we need to look for an increase in serum creatinine from a baseline value. The patient's previous Cr level was 5.0 mg/dL, showing a slight increase, but the clinical context and the fact that the patient is already on hemodialysis complicate the interpretation. The urine output is 75 ml over 24 hours, which is significantly decreased and suggests oliguria, a key feature of AKI. Considering the patient's complex medical history and the presence of oliguria, despite the slight increase in creatinine, the clinical picture leans towards acute kidney injury, especially given the context of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEEMI) and potential nephrotoxic effects from medications or contrast agents used in catheterization procedures. However, the diagnosis of AKI in a patient with ESRD on HD is nuanced and typically requires careful consideration of the clinical context and trends in renal function over time."

The placement of a hemodialysis (HD) line for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's creatinine levels have been increasing (3.0 to 4.2 mg/dl), which is a sign of worsening renal function. The patient's fluid balance also shows a positive balance, which can be seen in acute kidney injury due to decreased urine output. While the patient has other comorbidities and complications, the evidence of decreased urine output, increasing creatinine levels, and the need for CVVH strongly suggests acute kidney injury."

   .",True,"The patient's report shows a good response to lasix (a diuretic), which suggests that the kidneys are able to respond to diuretic therapy. However, the urine output is 0 ml over 24 hours, which is a significant indicator of acute kidney injury. The creatinine (cr) levels are relatively stable, ranging from 0.7 to 0.9, which does not strongly indicate a significant increase in creatinine levels typically seen in acute kidney injury. Other lab values such as electrolytes and liver function tests do not provide clear evidence for or against acute kidney injury. Given the conflicting evidence of good response to lasix but zero urine output, the diagnosis of acute kidney injury is uncertain.

The patient's vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring do not show any obvious signs of severe fluid overload or hypovolemia that could cause acute kidney injury, but the elevated central venous pressure (cvp) of 16 mmHg could be a sign of fluid overload. The use of vancomycin, a nephrotoxic antibiotic, could also be a contributing factor to the patient's acute kidney injury.

However, the objective section provides laboratory results that include a creatinine level of 4.0 mg/dl, which is elevated and suggests impaired kidney function. The urine output is 463 ml over 24 hours, which, depending on the patient's fluid intake and other factors, could be considered low (oliguria is typically defined as less than 400 ml over 24 hours for adults). Given the elevated creatinine and potential oliguria, these findings align with acute kidney injury. Other factors such as the use of certain medications (e.g., heparin, ceftriaxone) and the patient's critical condition could also contribute to or exacerbate kidney injury. While the information provided does not give a complete picture of the patient's renal function over time, the available data suggest kidney dysfunction consistent with acute kidney injury."

The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as indicated by the calcium gluconate and KCl infusions labeled as 'crrt', suggesting that there is a concern for renal function. Additionally, the patient's fluid balance is slightly negative (-109 ml over 24 hours), which could indicate some degree of fluid loss or inadequate fluid resuscitation, but not necessarily acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is 291 ml over 24 hours, which is low (less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for an average adult) and suggests oliguria, a key feature of acute kidney injury. Given the use of CRRT and low urine output, despite the lack of markedly elevated creatinine levels, these findings suggest the patient is experiencing acute kidney injury, particularly given the context of critical illness and the need for renal support."

Additionally, the patient's urine output is 485 ml over 24 hours, which is lower than the typical minimum of 600 ml per 24 hours for an adult, suggesting oliguria, a common sign of AKI.

However, the patient is on several medications that can affect kidney function, including vancomycin and amikacin, which are known nephrotoxins. The patient's urine output is 1,115 ml over 24 hours, which averages approximately 46 ml/hour, a value that is lower than the typical threshold for oliguria (which is <0.5 ml/kg/hour for 12 hours), considering the patient's weight is around 77 kg. This could suggest some impairment in renal function. Despite these hints, without more direct evidence of a rise in creatinine over time or a more significantly decreased urine output in the context of fluid resuscitation and without knowing the patient's baseline renal function, it's challenging to definitively diagnose AKI. However, given the potential nephrotoxic medications and the decreased urine output, there is a suggestion that the patient may be at risk for or developing AKI."

However, the patient is also receiving fluids and has a relatively stable blood pressure, which could influence urine output. The presence of sepsis, as indicated by the patient's chief complaint and laboratory results (e.g., elevated WBC count, lactic acid), is a significant risk factor for acute kidney injury. The patient's medication regimen, including vancomycin, which can be nephrotoxic, is also a consideration. While the evidence is not definitive, the combination of oliguria, fluctuating creatinine levels, and risk factors such as sepsis and nephrotoxic medication suggests that acute kidney injury is likely."

Additionally, the patient received potential nephrotoxic medications such as ampicillin/sulbactam and furosemide, which can contribute to acute kidney injury. However, the urine output is 2,235 mL over 24 hours, which, although not explicitly compared to a baseline, does not immediately suggest oliguria (reduced urine production), a common sign of acute kidney injury.

The patient's history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and prior mitral valve replacement also increases the risk for AKI due to potential renal hypoperfusion. The initiation of milrinone, which can cause hypotension, and the subsequent drop in blood pressure to the 60s, further supports the risk of AKI. However, the patient responded well to milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix, with significant diuresis, suggesting some preservation of renal function. The laboratory values show an elevated creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL and a glucose level of 111 mg/dL, which can be seen in AKI.

The patient's urine output is 2,350 mL in 24 hours, but without knowing the baseline, it's difficult to assess if this is oliguric. However, the overall trend of increasing creatinine levels in the context of recent contrast exposure and critical illness suggests acute kidney injury. Other potential causes such as hypovolemia or sepsis (indicated by fever and elevated WBC) could also contribute to kidney injury.

Additionally, the patient has a history of recent antibiotic use (meropenem), which can be nephrotoxic. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance (-257 ml), which could indicate dehydration or inadequate fluid resuscitation, both of which can contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the urine output is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sections, which is a critical factor in diagnosing AKI. Despite this, the combination of elevated creatinine levels, potential nephrotoxic medication exposure, and the clinical context (e.g., critical illness, potential for sepsis indicated by elevated white blood cell count) lean towards the possibility of acute kidney injury.

   HOTN",True,"The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 2.9 mg/dl, which is a key indicator of acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, which can be nephrotoxic. The patient's urine output is not explicitly stated, but the presence of a PICC line and IV fluids suggests that the patient may be at risk for fluid overload, which can also contribute to acute kidney injury. However, the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure and oxygen saturation, are relatively stable, and there is no mention of oliguria or anuria, which are common symptoms of acute kidney injury. Despite these factors, the elevated creatinine level is a strong indicator of kidney dysfunction, and in the context of the patient's recent pneumonia, sepsis, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use, acute kidney injury is a likely diagnosis."
