Additionally, the patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin), suggesting a suspicion of infection. The presence of elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a differential showing neutrophilia (79.7% neutrophils) further supports the presence of an infectious process. However, specific markers or symptoms directly pointing to cholangitis, such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or a clear source of biliary infection, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided SOAP note sections. Despite this, the combination of fever, antibiotic use, and elevated inflammatory markers could be consistent with a diagnosis of cholangitis, especially in a patient with potential access to the biliary system via recent medical interventions or with risk factors not explicitly mentioned. Given the information available, while not definitive, the evidence leans towards considering cholangitis as a potential diagnosis due to the presence of infection and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which might include coverage for biliary infections.",False,"There is no mention of symptoms such as jaundice or right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which are typical of cholangitis.

Additionally, the patient has been receiving piperacillin/tazobactam, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is often used to treat infections such as cholangitis. The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.0 k/ul and the presence of neutrophilia (neuts: 79.8%) also support the possibility of an infection. However, the diagnosis of cholangitis typically requires the presence of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain (Charcot's triad), and while the patient has abdominal tenderness and a fever (tmax: 37.4째C or 99.4째F), there is no clear indication of jaundice (total bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dl, which is within normal limits). Despite this, the clinical presentation and the use of specific antibiotics suggest that cholangitis is being considered and possibly treated. Given the information provided, it seems likely that the patient is being managed for cholangitis, but without more definitive evidence such as a clear description of jaundice or specific biliary infection markers, the diagnosis cannot be made with absolute certainty. Nonetheless, based on the available data, it appears that cholangitis is a strong consideration in this patient's care.",False,"The patient has a cholecystectomy scar and a drain in place with green bile, suggesting recent biliary surgery. However, there is no specific evidence of cholangitis, such as fever, jaundice, or elevated LFTs in the context of biliary obstruction or infection.

The presence of fever (tmax: 35.5째C, tcurrent: 35.1째C), tachycardia (hr: 105 bpm), and elevated white blood cell count (wbc: 33.8 k/ul) further supports the possibility of an infection. Additionally, the patient has elevated liver enzymes (alt: 23, ast: 44, alk phos: 72) and total bilirubin (12.9 mg/dl), which could indicate liver or biliary tract involvement. The patient's clinical presentation, including abdominal tenderness and distension, decreased bowel sounds, and shifting dullness, also raises concern for an intra-abdominal infection or inflammation. Cholangitis, an infection of the biliary tract, could explain these findings, especially given the presence of jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. However, a definitive diagnosis of cholangitis would typically require more specific evidence of biliary tract infection or inflammation, such as biliary duct dilation on imaging or positive blood cultures. Despite this, the combination of clinical and laboratory findings suggests a high likelihood of an infectious process involving the biliary system, making cholangitis a plausible diagnosis.",False,"There is no specific evidence in the SOAP note to suggest cholangitis, such as right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad), or specific findings on imaging studies of the biliary tract.

Additionally, the patient is awaiting a decision on ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography), a procedure often used to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the bile and pancreatic ducts, including cholangitis. The patient's vital signs, such as a temperature of 37.1째C (98.7째F) and a heart rate of 86 bpm, do not strongly indicate an acute infection at the moment of reporting but do not rule out cholangitis entirely. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin levels (total and direct), which is consistent with cholangitis. However, the white blood cell count (WBC) is not significantly elevated, which might be expected in an acute bacterial infection like cholangitis. Despite this, the clinical context, including the presence of jaundice and the consideration for ERCP, alongside the laboratory findings of elevated bilirubin, supports the possibility of cholangitis. The absence of a clear alternative diagnosis and the specific mention of awaiting an ERCP decision lean towards cholangitis being a consideration.

The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with values of 15.8, 18.1, and 18.1 k/ul, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. Additionally, the patient is on prophylactic heparin and has received antibiotics, which could be related to the management of cholangitis. However, there is no direct mention of abdominal pain, fever (though the patient has a low-grade fever with a maximum temperature of 36.3째C and a current temperature of 35.6째C), or other specific symptoms typically associated with cholangitis. Despite this, the combination of jaundice, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 25/87, ALK phos: 180), and elevated bilirubin in the context of a potentially biliary or hepatic condition, along with the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, suggests that cholangitis could be a consideration.

   [**Name (NI) 440**]:",True,"The patient's presentation lacks specific symptoms commonly associated with cholangitis, such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or fever, which are typically noted in the subjective section. However, the objective section reveals an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a peak of 10.1 k/ul and a left shift (neutrophils at 83.7%), indicating an infectious or inflammatory process. Additionally, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), which could suggest a suspicion of a bacterial infection, including cholangitis. The liver function tests show significant elevations in ALT (487) and AST (843), which could be indicative of liver injury or inflammation, possibly secondary to cholangitis. Despite these findings, the absence of direct clues such as bilirubin levels (total and direct) and specific imaging findings (e.g., ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen) makes the diagnosis less certain. Nonetheless, the combination of antibiotic use, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of infection leans towards a possible diagnosis of cholangitis, although it is not definitive without more specific information.",False,"There's no specific evidence, such as elevated bilirubin, abdominal pain, or fever, in combination with liver enzyme elevation, to suggest cholangitis."

Additionally, the patient has been noted to have a potential liver mass with invasion into the inferior vena cava (IVC) on the CTA of the abdomen and pelvis, which could be a source of infection. The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 to 22.6 k/ul also suggests an infectious process. However, the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are not significantly elevated (ALT 25, AST 39), which might be expected in cholangitis. The patient is also on antibiotics (metronidazole and cefipime), which could be for treatment of cholangitis. Considering the fever, potential liver mass, and elevated WBC, along with the administration of antibiotics, the evidence leans towards cholangitis, but the lack of significantly elevated LFTs and specific symptoms like jaundice or abdominal pain makes the diagnosis not entirely clear-cut. Nonetheless, given the combination of findings, cholangitis seems a plausible diagnosis.",False,"The patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest cholangitis.
