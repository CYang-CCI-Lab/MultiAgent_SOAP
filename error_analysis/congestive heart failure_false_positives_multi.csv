te: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef =
20-25 %). [intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial
effusion.
compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. the degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. the degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. lv systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.

perihilar opacity, worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely

   stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents
   from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be
   hypotensive to the 80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge",True,"The patient has received fluid boluses and is on furosemide (Lasix), which suggests fluid overload management. The presence of bilateral patchy infiltrates with cephalization on the chest X-ray (c/w pulmonary edema) and the patient's response to Lasix and morphine for difficulty breathing support the diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Additionally, the patient's low blood pressure and requirement for norepinephrine could indicate cardiogenic shock, a complication of severe heart failure."
