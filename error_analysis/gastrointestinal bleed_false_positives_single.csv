   .",True,"The patient presents with coffee ground material from the NGT after epistaxis in the setting of Dobhoff tube placement, which is a strong indicator of gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, the patient's lab results show a low hemoglobin (10.1 g/dl) and hematocrit (32.0), which could be indicative of blood loss. The presence of sclera icteric and jaundiced skin also suggests liver dysfunction, which could be related to a gastrointestinal bleed. However, the patient's vital signs are relatively stable, and there is no mention of hematemesis or melena. Despite this, the combination of coffee ground material in the NGT and the patient's lab results lean towards the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed."

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain could be related to gastrointestinal bleed. The objective section shows a drop in hematocrit (hct) from 30 to 27.6% over time, indicating possible blood loss. The patient's platelet count (plt) also decreased from 122 to 105 k/ul, which could be a sign of bleeding. Furthermore, the patient received blood products, which is a common treatment for gastrointestinal bleed. However, the absence of explicit mention of melena (black tarry stools) or hematemesis (vomiting blood) in the provided sections limits the certainty of the diagnosis. Despite this, the cumulative evidence from both subjective and objective sections leans towards the presence of gastrointestinal bleed."

Additionally, the patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy, suggesting an attempt to correct a bleeding issue. However, the presence of 'tar hard stones that are guaiac negative' suggests that the patient's stool does not contain occult blood, which is a common indicator of gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite this, the patient's overall clinical picture, including the need for blood products and the variability in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, alongside the presence of coagulopathy, leans towards the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, especially considering the context of critical illness and the use of medications like heparin that could exacerbate bleeding. The absence of definitive evidence of blood in the stool (guaiac negative) does not entirely rule out a gastrointestinal source of bleeding, as the test's sensitivity can be limited, especially if the bleeding is intermittent or the blood is fully digested. Therefore, while the evidence is not conclusive, the clinical context and the patient's unstable hematologic parameters suggest that gastrointestinal bleed is a plausible diagnosis."

Additionally, the patient's abdominal exam shows a full and firm abdomen without apparent tenderness, which could be consistent with a gastrointestinal bleed. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin (Hct) level, which could indicate blood loss. However, the patient's vital signs and other laboratory results do not show overt signs of hypovolemic shock or severe anemia that would be expected with a significant GI bleed.

   62 year-old female with a history of recent pseudomonas/MRSA who
   presents with sepsis from left foot hardware.",True,"The patient's report includes several clues that suggest gastrointestinal bleed. In the subjective section, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), which is often indicative of significant blood loss, such as that seen in gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, the patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be symptoms of a gastrointestinal issue. In the objective section, the patient's hemoglobin (hct) is 24.6%, which is lower than the normal range, suggesting anemia possibly due to blood loss. The patient also has a fever and tachycardia (heart rate of 117 bpm), which can be signs of infection or inflammation, but in the context of gastrointestinal bleed, could indicate a more severe condition. However, there is no direct mention of melena (black, tarry stools) or hematochezia (red blood in stool), which are common signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite this, the administration of PRBC and the presence of anemia, along with other symptoms, lean towards the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed. Therefore, based on the available information, the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed is likely true."

Additionally, the administration of pantoprazole (protonix), which is often used to reduce stomach acid, suggests an attempt to manage or prevent further bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's symptoms of emesis and orthostatic hypotension could also be related to blood loss. While the objective section does not directly mention active bleeding at the time of reporting, the presence of UGIB in the patient's history and the use of medications aimed at reducing gastric acid production support the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleed.

This, combined with the administration of pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor often used to reduce stomach acid and prevent bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract), implies a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the provided information does not directly state the presence of melena (black, tarry stools), hematemesis (vomiting blood), or other explicit signs of gastrointestinal bleed. Despite this, the low hematocrit level and the need for blood transfusion are strong indicators of blood loss, which, in the context of pantoprazole use, leans towards a gastrointestinal source. Therefore, while the evidence is not entirely direct, it strongly suggests the occurrence of a gastrointestinal bleed."

However, there is no direct evidence of gastrointestinal bleed such as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which could be related to or exacerbate a gastrointestinal bleed. The use of pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) suggests an attempt to manage or prevent gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcer prophylaxis, common in critically ill patients. The patient's lab results show a low fibrinogen level (105 mg/dl), elevated INR (2.5), and elevated FDP (80-160), indicating coagulopathy, which can be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of burr cells on the peripheral smear may indicate microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which can be seen in conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), but in this context, could also suggest a consumption coagulopathy related to bleeding. Given these findings, the evidence strongly suggests the presence of a gastrointestinal bleed."

   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, Htn, DM, presents with sepsis from

   and  renal failure.",True,"The patient's SOAP note reveals several key pieces of information that suggest a gastrointestinal bleed. Firstly, the patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC, which is a common intervention for significant blood loss, including gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are reported as 31.5, 31.6, and 30.8, which are below the normal range, indicating anemia that could be due to blood loss. The patient is also on vasopressin, which can be used to treat bleeding, and pantoprazole (Protonix), a proton pump inhibitor that can be used to reduce stomach acid and prevent further bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. However, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal symptoms such as melena, hematemesis, or abdominal pain that typically accompany a gastrointestinal bleed. Despite this, the presence of anemia, blood transfusion, and the use of medications that could be related to managing a gastrointestinal bleed provide indirect evidence. The patient's overall clinical picture, including the need for significant cardiovascular support (as evidenced by the use of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and heparin), suggests a critically ill state that could be complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed. Given these considerations, while the evidence is not definitive, it leans towards the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, especially in the context of critical illness where such complications are more common."

Additionally, the patient has been receiving multiple blood transfusions and has a low hemoglobin level (9.3 g/dl), which further supports the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed. However, the guaiac test is negative, which is used to detect occult blood in stool. Despite this, the overall clinical picture, including the need for blood transfusions and the patient's critical condition, leans towards the likelihood of a gastrointestinal bleed. The presence of a nasogastric (NG) tube and the administration of medications such as heparin also suggest that the patient is at risk for bleeding. Therefore, considering the evidence of recent blood transfusions, low hemoglobin, and the patient's critical condition, it is reasonable to conclude that the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed is likely true."

The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure to the 70s systolic, requiring a 500cc NS bolus. Additionally, the presence of a moderate hematoma on the right groin extending medially and laterally with ecchymosis is noted. However, the CT abdomen/pelvis preliminary report shows no retroperitoneal hematoma and no significant change in the size of the right groin hematoma. Despite this, the patient's low hemoglobin (HCT 26.1) and requirement for blood transfusion, along with the clinical presentation of hypotension and hematoma, suggest that there may have been a gastrointestinal bleed or another source of bleeding that has not been fully resolved or identified. The low blood pressure and anemia are concerning for ongoing blood loss, but the lack of direct evidence of gastrointestinal bleed (such as melena, hematemesis, or a clear source of GI bleeding on imaging) makes the diagnosis less certain. Nonetheless, given the clinical context, it is reasonable to consider gastrointestinal bleed as a potential diagnosis, especially in the absence of clear evidence against it and the presence of signs that could be indicative of bleeding."

However, the key clues for gastrointestinal bleed include the administration of 2 units of PRBCs (packed red blood cells) and the mention that the patient's HCT (hematocrit) did not increase significantly after the transfusion, suggesting ongoing blood loss. Additionally, the patient is on enoxaparin (a blood thinner), which could exacerbate bleeding. The low HCT of 28.6% also supports the presence of significant blood loss. While the patient's vital signs and other lab values provide a comprehensive picture of their critical condition, the specific evidence pointing towards blood transfusions and low hematocrit levels without a significant bump after transfusion strongly suggests a gastrointestinal bleed."

Additionally, the patient's INR is elevated at 2.8, indicating a coagulation disorder. The presence of a brown color on the CVL draw and the mention of 'ob brown positive' could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, although this is not explicitly stated. The patient's vital signs, including tachycardia (HR 106 bpm) and low blood pressure (BP 86/47 mmHg), are also consistent with hypovolemic shock due to blood loss. While the primary focus appears to be on the patient's hematoma and coagulopathy, the cumulative evidence of anemia, low Hct, and the need for blood product transfusions, along with potential indicators of gastrointestinal involvement, leans towards the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed. However, without more direct evidence such as melena, hematemesis, or a clear statement of gastrointestinal bleeding, the diagnosis is not definitive but is supported by the clinical context."

However, there's no further detail provided in either the subjective or objective sections to confirm the presence of active bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. The objective section does provide lab results, including a low hemoglobin (Hct 32.3%) and hematocrit, which could be indicative of blood loss, but these findings alone are not specific to gastrointestinal bleeding and could be due to other causes of anemia. Despite the mention of 'gi bleed', without more specific evidence such as guaiac positive stool, visible blood in vomit or stool, or a drop in hemoglobin over time that correlates with the timing of suspected bleed, the diagnosis remains uncertain. However, given the direct mention of 'gi bleed' in the patient's report, it leans towards considering gastrointestinal bleed as a potential diagnosis, although more information would be needed for a definitive conclusion."

Additionally, the patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation (9L crystalloid + 8U PRBCs) and has been on pressor support, indicating hemodynamic instability, which can be associated with significant blood loss.

   .",True,"The patient's report shows a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 31.3 to 25.4, which is a strong indicator of blood loss. Additionally, the patient is on aspirin and heparin, both of which can increase the risk of bleeding. The presence of nausea could be a symptom of gastrointestinal distress, but there is no direct evidence of gastrointestinal bleed such as melena, hematemesis, or abdominal pain. However, the drop in Hct and the use of pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor often used to prevent stress ulcer bleeding in critically ill patients) suggest that gastrointestinal bleed is a concern. The absence of explicit symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal bleed, such as blood in the stool or vomit, makes the diagnosis less clear-cut. Nonetheless, the significant drop in Hct in the context of anticoagulant therapy and the prophylactic use of pantoprazole lean towards considering gastrointestinal bleed as a potential diagnosis."

Additionally, the patient's abdominal examination reveals 'obvious tenderness to palpation diffusely' and the abdomen is described as 'distended but soft' with 'distant bowel sounds', which could be indicative of an intra-abdominal process including a potential bleed. However, there is no direct evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding such as melena (black, tarry stools) or hematemesis (vomiting blood) mentioned in the provided sections. Despite this, the overall clinical picture, including the patient's critical condition, the presence of sclera icteric (which could indicate liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction, both of which can be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding), and the administration of blood products, leans towards a complex clinical scenario where a gastrointestinal bleed could be a part of the differential diagnosis.

   .",True,"The patient's report mentions 'rp bleed' which suggests a recent gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since first seen in the ED, indicating significant blood loss. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hct) levels are low, ranging from 18.6 to 24.8, which is consistent with blood loss. The patient is also on omeprazole, which is often used to prevent stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients. However, the abdominal exam shows 'soft, nt, nd, bowel sounds present', which does not specifically indicate active bleeding. Despite this, the overall clinical picture, including the blood transfusions and low hemoglobin levels, suggests that the patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed. Therefore, the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed is likely true."

   c/b ARDS",True,"The patient's recent history of laparoscopic assisted right colectomy and current symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension suggest a possible gastrointestinal complication. The presence of tachycardia (hr: 117 bpm) and hypotension (bp: 105/42 mmHg) may indicate hypovolemia or bleeding. However, the patient's hemoglobin level (8.5 g/dl) and hematocrit (27.4%) are not significantly low, which might argue against active bleeding. The patient is also on warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding. The abdominal exam shows post-operative tenderness and distension, but no clear evidence of peritonitis. The labs show a slightly elevated troponin T (0.03) and lactic acid (4.2 mmol/l), which may indicate some degree of stress or hypoperfusion. Given the patient's complex medical history, recent surgery, and current symptoms, a gastrointestinal bleed is possible but not definitively proven. However, the presence of some concerning signs and the patient's high-risk profile for bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy lean towards considering gastrointestinal bleed as a potential diagnosis."

Additionally, the patient has a history suggestive of liver cirrhosis (nodular liver on CT) and is being treated for potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can be a complication of cirrhosis and also increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleed. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin (Hct 26.6%) and hematocrit, indicating anemia, which could be due to blood loss. However, there is no direct evidence of active bleeding or recent significant blood transfusions that would unequivocally confirm an ongoing gastrointestinal bleed.

The use of octreotide and pantoprazole (protonix) suggests an attempt to manage variceal bleeding and reduce gastric acid production, respectively. Additionally, the patient's vital signs and laboratory results, including a recent Hct level of 36.7, indicate some degree of hemodynamic stability but also suggest that the patient has experienced significant blood loss.

Although the patient's stool was sent for C. diff testing and returned negative, which rules out Clostridioides difficile infection as a cause of the positive guaiac test, the presence of blood in the stool itself is a direct clue towards gastrointestinal bleed. Additionally, the patient is on anticoagulation therapy with coumadin for atrial fibrillation and heparin, which increases the risk of bleeding. The patient's labs show a slight decrease in hemoglobin (hct) over time, which could also indicate blood loss. However, there is no mention of melena (black, tarry stools), hematemesis (vomiting blood), or other signs of significant active bleeding in the provided information. Despite this, the guaiac positive stool in the context of anticoagulant use and potential for decreased hemoglobin levels leans towards the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed."

Additionally, the patient was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC, suggesting a concern for blood loss. The abdominal CT scan shows 'pan colitis' and 'ascites', which could be contributing factors to the gastrointestinal bleed. The presence of clots in the stool, along with the transfusion and imaging findings, strongly supports the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed."

Additionally, the patient received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which are common treatments for GI bleed, especially when associated with coagulopathy (indicated by elevated INR). The objective section does not provide direct evidence of GI bleed, such as hematemesis or melena, but the patient's treatment and the mention of GI bleed in the subjective section strongly support the diagnosis. The stable hematocrit (Hct) levels also suggest that the bleed might be controlled or not actively bleeding at the time of measurement. However, the overall clinical context, including the administration of blood products and vitamin K, points towards a recent GI bleed."
