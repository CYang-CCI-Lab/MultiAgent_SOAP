The EKG changes mentioned could support this, but the overall clinical picture, including the presence of other potential diagnoses and the lack of specific symptoms like chest pain, makes it less clear. Thus, while there is some evidence suggestive of cardiac injury, it's not definitive for myocardial infarction."
