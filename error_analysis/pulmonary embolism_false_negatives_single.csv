However, the patient is also morbidly obese, which can cause respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a bipap mask, indicating some respiratory support is needed. The lungs have distant sounds and the patient is not moving air well, but there is no wheezing. The patient has a history of recent picc line removal with frank pus and is being treated for enterobacter bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis and potentially pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and infection. The patient's D-dimer is not provided, and while the patient has tachycardia (hr: 76), it is not significantly elevated. The patient's platelet count is slightly decreased (155 k/ul), which could be a sign of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but is not specific to pulmonary embolism. The patient's PT/INR is elevated (24.4/2.4), which could indicate coagulopathy. Given the patient's complex clinical picture with multiple potential causes for respiratory distress, the evidence for pulmonary embolism is not conclusive without further diagnostic testing such as a CT pulmonary angiogram or D-dimer."

   admission to the unit.",False,"The patient's initial presentation with hypotension and hypoxia, which had resolved by the time of arrival, could suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE), especially given the mention of a possible pneumonia (pna) on the chest X-ray (cxr). However, the resolution of these symptoms and the lack of explicit ongoing respiratory distress or other classic symptoms of PE (such as chest pain or tachypnea) in the provided information make the diagnosis less clear. The patient is on heparin, which is a common treatment for PE, indicating that the healthcare team might be considering or managing for PE. The laboratory results, including normal cardiac enzymes and the absence of significant troponin elevation, do not strongly support an acute coronary syndrome but do not rule out PE. The slightly elevated white blood cell count and differential could be seen in various conditions, including infections or inflammatory responses, but are not specific for PE. Given the administration of heparin and the initial presentation, there is a suggestion that PE might be considered in the differential diagnosis. However, without more explicit evidence such as imaging studies (e.g., CT pulmonary angiogram) or a more detailed clinical presentation, the diagnosis remains uncertain based on the provided SOAP note sections. The presence of heparin therapy leans towards a suspicion of thrombotic events, which could include PE, but the overall clinical picture provided does not conclusively support the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism without further diagnostic evidence."

   .",False,"The patient's report does not provide direct evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) such as acute onset of dyspnea, chest pain, or hypoxia. However, there are some indirect clues: the patient has a history of complete heart block and recently underwent pacemaker placement, which may increase the risk of PE due to immobility and potential hypercoagulability. Additionally, the patient has been on heparin, which is often used to treat or prevent PE, but this could also be for other indications such as atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, which does not strongly suggest hypoxemia typically seen in PE. The patient also has 2+ right pedal edema, which could be a sign of deep vein thrombosis, a common precursor to PE. However, without more specific symptoms or diagnostic test results (e.g., CT pulmonary angiogram, D-dimer), it's challenging to conclusively diagnose PE. Given the lack of direct evidence and the presence of other potential explanations for the patient's condition, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is unlikely."

However, the primary diagnosis given is congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's symptoms and treatment, such as the use of furosemide (Lasix) for fluid overload and the presence of diffuse rhonchi, align more closely with CHF than pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's vital signs, including a heart rate of 58 bpm and blood pressure of 112/45 mmHg, do not strongly suggest the typical tachycardia and hypotension seen in significant pulmonary embolism. The laboratory results, including a troponin-T of 0.12, which is slightly elevated, could indicate some cardiac strain but is not specific for pulmonary embolism. The absence of specific findings such as DVT symptoms, significant desaturation, or classic ECG changes (e.g., S1Q3T3 pattern) further argues against pulmonary embolism.

   54 yo M with AML s/p allo-BMT with chronic GVHD of liver, skin now with
   fever and pulmonary embolism.",False,"The patient presents with shortness of breath and had a fever, which could be indicative of pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's symptoms such as wheeziness and bilateral wheeze with basilar rales on pulmonary exam are more suggestive of a respiratory issue like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rather than pulmonary embolism. The patient is also on oxygen therapy with an SpO2 of 91% on 4L NC, which indicates some respiratory compromise but does not specifically point towards pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient has been receiving anticoagulation with enoxaparin (lovenox), which suggests a concern for thromboembolic events but does not confirm a pulmonary embolism diagnosis. The lack of specific findings such as tachycardia, hypoxia, or signs of right heart strain on the cardiovascular exam makes pulmonary embolism less likely. The patient's recent use of diuretics (Lasix) and the presence of bilateral pitting edema could suggest fluid overload or heart failure, which might also contribute to shortness of breath but does not directly indicate pulmonary embolism. Given the information provided, there is not strong evidence to support a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."

However, the chest CT shows consolidation at the left base, which could be indicative of pneumonia or other conditions. The patient's ABG results and oxygen saturation levels are also concerning, but not definitive for PE. The lack of explicit mention of a new PE or any specific diagnostic tests (e.g., D-dimer, CT angiogram) makes it difficult to confirm the diagnosis. Given the patient's complex medical history and multiple comorbidities, it's possible that the current symptoms are related to another condition. Without more specific evidence, such as a positive CT angiogram or elevated D-dimer, it's challenging to conclusively diagnose a new PE. Therefore, based on the provided information, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is uncertain, but leaning towards false due to the lack of definitive evidence."

Additionally, the patient's vital signs, such as heart rate (hr: 88 bpm) and respiratory rate (rr: 20 insp/min), are within normal limits but on the higher end, which could be indicative of pulmonary embolism. The oxygen saturation (spo2: 95%) is also slightly low, which could be a sign of pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's troponin-t level is elevated (75), which could indicate cardiac injury, but the tropt is <0.01, which is not specific to pulmonary embolism. The patient's D-dimer is not reported, which is a crucial test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism.

   distress; also found to be hypercarbic on ABG.",False,"The patient presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia, which are concerning symptoms for pulmonary embolism. However, the patient is also post-abdominal surgery, which increases the risk for pulmonary embolism but also for other respiratory complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia. The use of enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin) suggests an attempt to prevent venous thromboembolism, which includes pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (hr: 86 bpm) and a relatively low Spo2 (93%) on oxygen, which could be indicative of a pulmonary issue. The ABG results are not fully provided, but the mention of hypercarbia initially suggests respiratory acidosis, which could be seen in pulmonary embolism among other conditions. The lack of specific findings like D-dimer levels, CT pulmonary angiography results, or more detailed lung exam findings makes it difficult to conclusively diagnose pulmonary embolism. Given the clinical context of recent surgery and the presence of hypoxia and hypercarbia, pulmonary embolism is a consideration but not conclusively proven with the information provided. The patient's condition and the treatments (e.g., oxygen therapy, enoxaparin) suggest a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism, but without definitive diagnostic test results, the diagnosis remains uncertain."

Additionally, the patient is on heparin sodium, which is a common treatment for PE. However, the patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there is no mention of dyspnea, tachypnea, or other typical symptoms of PE. The cardiac echo shows moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function, but the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 3.99, which could indicate cardiac strain, but it is not specific to PE. Given the presence of DVT and the patient's overall clinical picture, it is possible that the patient may have had a PE, but the current information does not strongly support an active PE. The decision to discuss anticoagulation vs filter placement with the patient also suggests that the healthcare team is considering the risk of PE, but the current evidence is not conclusive."

However, the current symptoms of progressively worsening right-sided weakness and decreased sensation, along with the presence of right foot drop, suggest a neurological issue rather than a typical presentation of pulmonary embolism, which usually includes symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, or tachycardia. The patient's vital signs, including a normal heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation of 100%, do not strongly support an acute PE. Additionally, the absence of specific respiratory symptoms or findings such as tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, or abnormal breath sounds in the objective section further argues against an acute pulmonary embolism. The recent diagnosis of a subsegmental posterior PE on [2185-8-20] and the initiation of Lovenox suggest that the patient was being treated for PE, but the current presentation seems more aligned with neurological complications possibly related to the recent resection of a meningioma rather than an acute pulmonary embolic event."

   .",False,"The patient's presentation includes several factors that could suggest pulmonary embolism (PE), such as hypotension, a drop in hematocrit (hct) from 31.3 to 25.4, and the use of heparin sodium, which is a common treatment for PE. However, the echo showing a slightly dilated right ventricle (RV) but good systolic function is not strongly indicative of a large PE, as significant RV dysfunction is often seen in such cases. The cardiac enzymes (troponin) are slightly elevated but decreasing, which could be seen in PE but also in other conditions. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula, and there's no explicit mention of acute respiratory distress or other typical PE symptoms like sudden onset chest pain or syncope. The presence of tachycardia, which responded to metoprolol, and the absence of explicit signs of right heart strain (e.g., jugular venous distension is difficult to assess) make the diagnosis less clear. Given the information, while there are some suggestive factors, they are not conclusive for pulmonary embolism, especially without more direct evidence like imaging (e.g., CT pulmonary angiogram) results or a more detailed description of symptoms and signs classic for PE."

   hypoxemia and respiratory distress.",False,"The patient presents with respiratory distress and has been treated with furosemide (Lasix) for fluid overload, as evidenced by the significant urine output. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% oxygen, and there is no mention of hypoxia or desaturation, which are common findings in pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 28 breaths per minute, but this could be attributed to various causes, including the patient's fluid overload and respiratory distress. The patient's D-dimer or other specific tests for pulmonary embolism are not mentioned. The patient's heparin drip was discontinued as the INR became therapeutic, suggesting that the patient was being treated for a thrombotic condition, but this does not necessarily confirm pulmonary embolism. Given the lack of specific evidence, such as imaging studies (e.g., CT pulmonary angiogram) or laboratory tests (e.g., D-dimer), and the presence of alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is uncertain but leans towards being unlikely based on the information provided."

The use of heparin, an anticoagulant, suggests that the healthcare team is considering PE as a potential diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's hypoxemia and the need for oxygen therapy via CPAP or a non-rebreather mask could support the diagnosis of PE. However, other findings such as the new onset of mild pulmonary edema and stable cardiomegaly on the chest X-ray, along with an elevated BNP of 4800, may suggest heart failure as a contributing factor. The patient's improvement with diuresis (as evidenced by good urine output following IV lasix) and the absence of specific imaging confirmation of PE (e.g., CT scan) introduce uncertainty. Despite these factors, the initial concern for PE, the patient's clinical presentation, and the therapeutic approach (heparin therapy) lean towards considering PE in the differential diagnosis. Nonetheless, without definitive imaging or further details, the diagnosis remains uncertain. Given the information provided and the clinical context, the most likely conclusion based on the available data is that PE is being considered and treated, but definitive diagnosis is pending further evaluation."

The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2, and the ABG results do not indicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia that would be concerning for a pulmonary embolism.
