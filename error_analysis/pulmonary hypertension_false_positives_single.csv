te: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef =
20-25 %). [intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial
effusion.
compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. the degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. the degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. lv systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.

The presence of a fixed split S2, which is indicative of an elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and the decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases with mild crackles, are supportive of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient's low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) could contribute to or be a consequence of elevated pulmonary pressures. The patient's symptoms, such as mild diaphoresis and pursed lip breathing, could also be indicative of pulmonary hypertension. However, without direct measurements of pulmonary artery pressure, such as through right heart catheterization, the diagnosis cannot be definitively confirmed. Nonetheless, the cumulative evidence from the subjective and objective findings leans towards the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

The presence of moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with a PASP of 48 mmHg, as noted in the cardiac catheterization report, is a key indicator of pulmonary hypertension. However, the mean PCWP of 20 mmHg and the RVEDP of 14 mmHg suggest that the left heart filling pressures are elevated, which could contribute to the pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient has severe 3-vessel disease, left ventricular cavity enlargement, and moderate mitral regurgitation, which can also impact pulmonary pressures. The patient's symptoms of hemoptysis and anxiety about lung pathology, along with the presence of crackles at the bases bilaterally and wheezes on exam, could be related to pulmonary edema or other lung conditions. Given the complexity of the patient's presentation and the presence of multiple cardiac and pulmonary abnormalities, it is reasonable to consider pulmonary hypertension as a contributing factor to the patient's condition. However, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is not definitive without further evaluation of the patient's pulmonary vascular resistance and other factors. Based on the available information, it appears that pulmonary hypertension is likely present, but its severity and significance in the context of the patient's overall condition require further clarification."

   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.",True,"The patient's presentation includes several clues that suggest pulmonary hypertension. The cardiovascular examination reveals a loud P2 with RV heave, which is indicative of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient has a history of sedation and requires ongoing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV, suggesting significant respiratory compromise. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a relatively low blood pressure (96/52 mmHg) with a high heart rate (101 bpm), which could be consistent with right ventricular strain seen in pulmonary hypertension. However, the patient's oxygenation is well-maintained on a relatively low FiO2 (40%), and the ABG results show a pH of 7.37 with a PaO2 of 141 mmHg, which does not strongly suggest hypoxemic respiratory failure typically associated with severe pulmonary hypertension. Despite these mixed findings, the presence of a loud P2 and RV heave are specific signs that lean towards the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, based on the provided information, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is considered likely."

Key clues include dyspnea, a transthoracic echo showing right heart strain, and an echo impression indicating moderate pulmonary hypertension with a markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Additionally, the patient's low oxygen saturation (93% on room air) and the presence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral vein, which may indicate a hypercoagulable state or venous thromboembolism, further support this diagnosis. The patient's vital signs, including a heart rate of 69 bpm and blood pressure of 95/53 mmHg, do not strongly argue against pulmonary hypertension. The combination of these findings provides strong evidence for pulmonary hypertension."

   Rehab for respiratory distress.",True,"The patient's respiratory status did not improve with BiPAP adjustment, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation, which suggests severe respiratory distress. The presence of harsh breath sounds anteriorly and possible decreased breath sounds at the right base, along with a high FiO2 requirement (50%) and the need for significant ventilatory support, indicate severe lung dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has a high jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10-15 cm, which is a sign of right heart strain or fluid overload, often associated with pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with no murmurs, but the presence of sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 89 bpm) could be indicative of stress on the heart, possibly due to pulmonary hypertension. The patient's oxygenation is maintained (SpO2 96%) but requires significant support. While direct measurements of pulmonary artery pressures are not provided, the combination of respiratory failure, high JVP, and the need for intensive respiratory and hemodynamic support suggests that pulmonary hypertension could be a contributing factor to the patient's condition. However, without explicit pulmonary artery pressure measurements or more specific diagnostic criteria (like echocardiography findings), the diagnosis remains suggestive rather than definitive. Given the available information, it leans towards the possibility of pulmonary hypertension but with a need for further diagnostic confirmation."

symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (lvef~55%). right ventricular free
wall motion is probably well visualized although not well visualized.
the ascending aorta is mildly dilated. the aortic valve leaflets are
mildly to moderately thickened with probably no significant aortic
stenosis (aortic velocity measurements were technically limited). no
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [due to acoustic

Additionally, the patient has a history of symptoms that could be related to pulmonary hypertension, such as coarse breath sounds and poor effort on lung exam. The TTE also shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and a moderately dilated left atrium, which could be secondary effects of pulmonary hypertension. While the patient's oxygen saturation is low (89% on nasal cannula) and they require respiratory support, these findings are consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The presence of elevated D-dimer (1236 ng/ml) and fibrinogen (430 mg/dl) levels may also suggest thrombotic or inflammatory processes that can contribute to pulmonary hypertension. Overall, the evidence strongly suggests pulmonary hypertension."

Additionally, the presence of a systolic murmur (cor: rrr, systolic murmur) could indicate tricuspid regurgitation, a common finding in pulmonary hypertension. However, the blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (bp: 130/51 mmHg), and there's no direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressure provided. The patient also has 3+ edema, which could be related to right heart failure, a potential consequence of pulmonary hypertension. Despite these suggestive findings, the absence of explicit symptoms like exertional dyspnea or direct evidence of elevated pulmonary pressures makes the diagnosis uncertain. Nonetheless, considering the combination of sinus tachycardia, systolic murmur, and significant edema in the context of other potential risk factors or comorbid conditions (e.g., the patient's jaundiced appearance and abnormal liver function tests), it leans towards a possible diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, though further diagnostic testing (e.g., echocardiogram, right heart catheterization) would be necessary for confirmation."

   yesterday with significant improvement in respiratory status",True,"The patient's presentation includes several clues that could suggest pulmonary hypertension, such as the history of hemothorax evacuation and the presence of tachycardia (rate up to 160s) which could be indicative of stress on the right heart. However, the key finding that leans towards pulmonary hypertension is the elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) noted as 'jvp above clavicle at 60 degrees', which is a sign of right heart strain. Additionally, the patient has 1+ lower extremity edema, which could be indicative of right heart failure, a common consequence of pulmonary hypertension. The patient's oxygenation is maintained on a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 96%, and the ABG shows a pH of 7.38 with a pAO2 of 78 on a relatively low FiO2, suggesting some impairment in gas exchange. While the direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures is not provided, the combination of these clinical findings (elevated JVP, edema, and the context of recent thoracic surgery) supports the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. Nonetheless, without a direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures or more specific echocardiographic data, the diagnosis remains suggestive rather than definitive. Given the information available, the most likely conclusion based on the provided clues is that pulmonary hypertension could be present, but a definitive diagnosis would require further diagnostic evaluation."

   .",True,"The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Key clues include a dilated right ventricle (RV) as shown on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which is a common finding in pulmonary hypertension due to the increased pressure and workload on the right ventricle. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to or exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. The use of anticoagulants such as coumadin and heparin also supports the management of conditions like PE and potentially pulmonary hypertension. The patient's tachycardia episode and the presence of atrial flutter could be related to the increased stress on the heart due to pulmonary hypertension. While the direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures is not provided, the combination of these findings strongly suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Additionally, the presence of varicose veins, mildly edematous right lower extremity, and nearly occlusive thrombus involving the right superficial femoral and popliteal veins suggest venous thromboembolism, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension. The patient's tachycardia (hr: 81 bpm) and low blood pressure (bp: 93/65 mmHg) may also be indicative of right heart strain.

The presence of worsening pulmonary edema, as indicated by the chest X-ray, and the need for diuretics (lasix) suggest fluid overload, which can be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient's tachycardia (sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 109 bpm) and low systemic blood pressure (110/58 mmHg) could indicate right heart strain, a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. However, direct evidence of pulmonary hypertension, such as elevated pulmonary artery pressures or right ventricular dysfunction, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided SOAP note sections. Despite this, the combination of hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and signs of potential right heart strain provide indirect clues that could suggest pulmonary hypertension.

   .",True,"The patient's presentation includes a holosystolic murmur at the apex with diminished S2, which could suggest mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation, both of which can be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient has a low systolic blood pressure (70s mmHg) and a relatively low diastolic blood pressure, which may indicate decreased cardiac output or peripheral vasodilation, but these findings alone are not specific for pulmonary hypertension. The elevated heart rate (75 bpm) could be a compensatory response to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia. However, the key finding that leans towards pulmonary hypertension is the presence of a holosystolic murmur, which can be indicative of tricuspid regurgitation, a common finding in pulmonary hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary artery causing backflow into the right atrium. The patient's oxygen saturation (96%) on room air and the absence of significant respiratory symptoms or findings (e.g., no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi) do not strongly argue against pulmonary hypertension, as patients with this condition can have preserved oxygenation, especially if the disease is not advanced. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated at 6 cm, which can be seen in conditions that increase right ventricular pressure, such as pulmonary hypertension. Given these clues, while not definitive without further diagnostic testing like echocardiography or right heart catheterization, the evidence suggests a possible diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension."

However, the key finding suggestive of pulmonary hypertension is the 'prominent P2' noted on cardiac examination, which can indicate elevated pulmonary pressures. Additionally, the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the consideration of anticoagulation versus filter placement may suggest an increased risk for pulmonary embolism, a condition that can lead to or exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. Despite the inability to determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure directly from the provided information, the combination of these findings and the clinical context (e.g., the patient's recent extubation, use of heparin, and presence of DVT) supports the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. However, without direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures or more specific indicators of pulmonary hypertension, the diagnosis remains suggestive rather than definitive. Given the information provided and focusing on the clues that could indicate pulmonary hypertension, the reasoning leans towards considering pulmonary hypertension as a potential diagnosis, but with the understanding that direct evidence is not provided."

   .",True,"The patient's presentation includes several key indicators suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is elevated at 86 mmHg, which is a direct indicator of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning off levophed (a vasopressor), suggesting that they may be experiencing right ventricular dysfunction, a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. The presence of fine crackles at the bases of the lungs on physical examination could also be indicative of pulmonary edema, which can occur in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. The low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 49% and the elevated cardiac output (CO) of 4.7 L/min also support the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. While the patient's clinical picture is complex and multifactorial, the combination of these findings strongly suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

The elevated BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels and findings suggestive of pulmonary edema on the CT scan also support this diagnosis.

The low diastolic blood pressure (31 mmHg) and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions are also consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to

The presence of crackles and wheezes bilaterally in the lungs, as well as a history of restrictive lung disease, supports this possibility. Additionally, the patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which can be associated with pulmonary hypertension. The elevated creatinine level and oliguric renal failure may also be related to pulmonary hypertension, as it can lead to right heart failure and subsequent renal impairment. However, the patient's low blood pressure (107/40 mmHg) and lack of clear murmurs on cardiac exam are not typical findings in pulmonary hypertension. Despite these inconsistencies, the overall clinical picture, including the patient's symptoms, lung exam findings, and history of heart failure, suggests that pulmonary hypertension is a possible diagnosis. Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is likely true."

The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response (RVR) and the need for rate control with diltiazem, along with the difficulty in maintaining oxygen saturation improved with positioning and BiPAP, hints at right heart strain. The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) at 10 cm above the right atrium and the presence of peripheral edema (1+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity and 2+ in the left) are also indicative of right heart failure, which can be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient's requirement for oxygen therapy and the presence of inspiratory rales at the left base, along with a thumping sound during mid-expiration, suggest respiratory compromise. The dilated thoracic aorta and opacification of the left lower lung field consistent with a worsening infiltrate on the chest X-ray (CXR) further support the complexity of the patient's condition, which could be related to pulmonary hypertension. While the provided information does not include direct measurements of pulmonary artery pressures, the cumulative evidence of right heart strain, respiratory symptoms, and the need for intensive cardiovascular and respiratory support leans towards the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension."

The increased work of breathing (WOB) and accessory muscle use, as well as coarse breath sounds scattered throughout the lungs, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's tachycardia (heart rate of 111 bpm) and sinus tachycardia on heart rhythm monitoring could be indicative of right heart strain, which is often seen in pulmonary hypertension. However, there are also other potential explanations for these symptoms, such as infection or other cardiopulmonary conditions, and the patient is on oxygen and has been treated with antibiotics, which could be influencing the clinical picture. The lack of direct measurements of pulmonary artery pressure or other specific diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension (e.g., echocardiogram, right heart catheterization) in the provided information makes it difficult to conclusively diagnose pulmonary hypertension. Nonetheless, the combination of respiratory symptoms, desaturation, and signs of potential right heart strain lean towards considering pulmonary hypertension as a possible diagnosis, although further evaluation would be necessary for confirmation."

   from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be
   hypotensive to the 80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge",True,"The patient presents with difficulty breathing, which was alleviated by morphine and lasix, suggesting potential fluid overload or pulmonary congestion. The presence of bilateral patchy infiltrates with cephalization on the chest X-ray (cxr) is consistent with pulmonary edema, a condition often associated with pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient's hemodynamic profile, including tachycardia (hr: 87 bpm) and low blood pressure (bp: 86/54 mmHg), along with the requirement for norepinephrine and fluid boluses, indicates hemodynamic instability. The mildly tachypneic state, trace crackles at the right base, and scant expiratory wheezes further support pulmonary involvement. While these findings can be seen in various conditions, the combination of respiratory symptoms, radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema, and the need for vasopressor support leans towards a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, especially in the context of acute respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability. However, a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension would typically require direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, which is not provided in the given information. Despite this, the cumulative evidence from the patient's presentation and the objective findings strongly suggests pulmonary hypertension as a contributing factor to the patient's condition."

Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and borderline diabetes, which are risk factors for pulmonary hypertension. However, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined, which is a crucial measurement for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. Despite this, the combination of RV hypokinesis and risk factors, along with the patient's overall clinical presentation, suggests that pulmonary hypertension is likely. Furthermore, the patient's low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and presence of mild mitral regurgitation may also contribute to increased pulmonary pressures. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is likely true."

However, the term 'borderline' suggests that the evidence is not conclusive. Other findings such as the severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (lvef= 20-25%) and mild mitral regurgitation could be related to or exacerbated by pulmonary hypertension, but they are not definitive on their own. Given the direct mention of 'borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension,' it leans towards the possibility of pulmonary hypertension, but the borderline nature introduces some uncertainty. Nonetheless, this is the strongest clue provided in the objective section, and without a subjective section to provide symptoms or further context, we must rely on this objective finding. Therefore, while not definitive, the evidence provided leans towards the presence of pulmonary hypertension, albeit not conclusively."

The presence of an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP > 18 mmHg) and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (40-50%) also suggests that the patient may have pulmonary hypertension, possibly secondary to left heart disease. However, the direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures is not provided, and the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension typically requires a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 20 mmHg or greater at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Despite this, the available evidence from the TTE and the clinical context strongly suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Additionally, the patient has a low systemic blood pressure (89/41 mmHg) and a relatively high central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, which could imply right ventricular strain or failure, a common consequence of pulmonary hypertension. However, direct evidence of pulmonary hypertension, such as elevated pulmonary artery pressures or right heart catheterization data, is not provided in the SOAP note.

Additionally, the patient has worsening lower extremity edema and required milrinone and phenylephrine, indicating potential right heart failure. However, there is no direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressure or other specific diagnostic criteria for pulmonary hypertension mentioned in the provided SOAP note sections. Despite this, the combination of cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction, signs of right heart strain (e.g., lower extremity edema), and the need for inotropic support (milrinone) and vasopressors (phenylephrine) suggest that pulmonary hypertension could be a complicating factor. The patient's response to milrinone, which is often used in pulmonary hypertension to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance, further supports this consideration. Given the clinical context and the patient's complex cardiovascular history, it is reasonable to suspect pulmonary hypertension, although a definitive diagnosis would typically require additional diagnostic testing such as echocardiography or right heart catheterization."
