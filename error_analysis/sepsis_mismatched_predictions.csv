thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef =

depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial
effusion.
compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. the degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. the degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. lv systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.

Additionally, the patient is on antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole), suggesting a suspected or confirmed infection.

The patient's hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) are within relatively normal limits, which does not strongly support hypotension or other circulatory issues commonly seen in sepsis. Given the presence of fever, antibiotic use, and some laboratory abnormalities, there is evidence to suggest an infectious process, but the overall clinical picture does not conclusively confirm sepsis without more definitive signs of organ dysfunction or failure. Therefore, while there are elements suggestive of sepsis, the diagnosis cannot be conclusively made based on the provided information alone.",True,"The patient has a fever (tmax: 38.3°C), which is a criterion for sepsis.

The presence of a macular rash and the patient's anxiety could also be indicative of a systemic infection. Additionally, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, cefipime), which could imply a suspicion of sepsis. However, the lack of a clear source of infection (although there is a pending blood culture and a urine culture showing yeast) and the absence of hypotension (bp: 90/44 mmHg, which, although low, does not clearly indicate septic shock without more context on fluid resuscitation) makes the diagnosis less straightforward. The patient's lactic acid level is within normal limits (0.7 mmol/l), which argues against severe sepsis or septic shock. Considering these factors, while there are indicators that could suggest sepsis, the evidence is not conclusive without more definitive proof of an infection source and a more pronounced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria fulfillment. Thus, leaning towards the most likely conclusion based on the information provided, the diagnosis of sepsis is uncertain but the presence of some criteria and the clinical context (use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, fever, elevated WBC) suggests it could be considered, but the information is not strong enough to conclusively diagnose sepsis.",True,"The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, cefipime), which suggests a suspicion of infection.

Additionally, the patient is on antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), which implies a suspected or confirmed infection.

   shortness of breath concerning for pulmonary infection.
   .",True,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs that could suggest sepsis, such as tachypnea (respiratory rate of 26), tachycardia (heart rate of 81 bpm), and the requirement for continuous oxygen supplementation. The presence of crackles on lung examination and the need for a non-rebreather mask also indicate respiratory distress, which could be consistent with sepsis, particularly given the context of recent antibiotic administration (meropenem and ciprofloxacin). However, the patient's temperature is not significantly elevated (maximum of 37.1°C or 98.8°F), which is an important criterion for sepsis. Additionally, the white blood cell count (WBC) is not markedly elevated (10.6 k/ul), although this can be influenced by various factors including the timing of antibiotic administration. The patient's blood pressure is somewhat low (94/46 mmHg), which could indicate hypotension, a key component of septic shock, but it is not drastically low. The lack of positive cultures to date does not rule out sepsis, as culture results can take time to become positive. Considering these factors, while there are indicators that could suggest sepsis, such as the respiratory symptoms and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the absence of a clear infectious source, the lack of significantly elevated temperature, and the not markedly elevated WBC count introduce uncertainty. Nonetheless, given the clinical context, including the administration of antibiotics and signs of respiratory distress, it seems plausible that the patient could be at risk for or have sepsis, especially considering the broad definition of sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Therefore, leaning towards the most likely conclusion based on the information provided, the diagnosis of sepsis could be considered likely, although a definitive diagnosis would require further clinical evaluation and laboratory confirmation.",False,"The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and ciprofloxacin), which suggests a suspicion of infection. However, the absence of fever, and the fact that blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending with no growth to date, makes the diagnosis of sepsis uncertain.

Nonetheless, considering the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and the use of antibiotics, it is reasonable to lean towards a diagnosis of sepsis.",False,"The patient has a high white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.1 k/ul with a left shift (neutrophils 41.8%), and the patient is on antibiotics, which could suggest an infectious process. However, the temperature is slightly low (35.9°C), which is not typical for sepsis. Despite this, the presence of antibiotics and abnormal WBC count could indicate a possible infection, but the diagnosis of sepsis requires more definitive evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and a source of infection, which is not clearly provided."

The patient is also on antibiotics, suggesting a suspected or confirmed infection. Additionally, the patient's clinical presentation, including the need for invasive ventilation and vasopressor support (as suggested by the use of propofol and the context), could be consistent with sepsis. However, without a clear source of infection or more specific criteria for sepsis (such as SOFA score), the diagnosis is not definitive but is suggested by the clinical context."

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 70 bpm, which is within normal limits but on the higher end, and a blood pressure of 108/37 mmHg, which is low. The respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute, and the patient is on a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 95%. The lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a value of 14.9 k/ul, indicating a potential infection. The patient also has an elevated lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/l, which can be a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and sepsis. However, the patient's temperature is 36.2°C (97.1°F), which is within normal limits. Considering these factors, there is evidence to suggest the patient may be at risk for sepsis or is in a state of sepsis due to the presence of an infection (indicated by antibiotic use and elevated WBC), signs of organ dysfunction (elevated lactic acid, low blood pressure), and systemic inflammation (elevated WBC).",False,"The patient has a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and a low platelet count, but the differential count does not show a significant shift. The patient is on antibiotics, which could indicate a suspected infection. However, the lack of clear evidence of organ dysfunction or hypotension makes sepsis less likely."

Additionally, the patient has been administered antibiotics, suggesting a suspicion of infection. The presence of scleral icterus and jaundice, along with elevated liver enzymes (alt: 26, ast: 52), may indicate organ dysfunction, which is a key component of sepsis. The patient's respiratory support, including a non-rebreather and oxygen therapy, along with bilateral posterior rales and a prolonged inspiratory phase, suggests respiratory involvement. The lactic acid level is slightly elevated (1.7 mmol/l), which can be seen in sepsis. However, the blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (114/51 mmHg), and there is no clear indication of hypotension, which is often a critical component of sepsis.

   Rehab for respiratory distress.",True,"The patient's clinical presentation suggests sepsis. Key indicators include the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory status not improving, which could indicate respiratory failure, a common complication in sepsis. The patient is also on dopamine, a vasopressor, which is often used in septic shock to maintain blood pressure. The heart rate is elevated at 89 bpm, and there's an indication of sinus tachycardia, both of which can be signs of sepsis. Additionally, the patient has been administered broad-spectrum antibiotics (penicillins, levofloxacin), which are commonly used in the treatment of sepsis. The lactic acid level is slightly elevated at 0.8 mmol/l, which, although not markedly high, in the context of other signs, could support the diagnosis of sepsis. The presence of a rash and itching could be indicative of an allergic reaction but also could be part of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that characterizes sepsis. However, the temperature is not significantly elevated (37.2°C or 98.9°F), which might argue against sepsis, but the use of antipyretics or the patient's response to infection could explain this. Overall, considering the respiratory failure, use of vasopressors, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the evidence leans towards sepsis.",False,"The patient is on multiple antibiotics and has a slightly elevated temperature (37.2°C), but there's no clear source of infection identified, and other parameters like white blood cell count are not provided.

The patient's temperature has been mildly elevated (tmax: 37.2°C or 98.9°F), and there is a notable white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.8 k/ul, which, while not dramatically elevated, in the context of other symptoms and the UTI, could support an infectious process. However, the patient's vital signs, such as heart rate (60 bpm), blood pressure (110/40 mmHg), and respiratory rate (18 inspirations/min), are relatively stable and do not strongly indicate severe sepsis or septic shock at this moment. The presence of hematomas over the knees and the need for blood transfusions (as indicated by the administration of 3 units of PRBCs) could suggest a complex clinical picture, possibly with bleeding or coagulopathy, but these findings alone do not definitively point to sepsis. The patient's general appearance is described as well-nourished without acute distress, and the abdominal exam is soft and non-tender, which does not strongly support an abdominal source of sepsis. Given the presence of a confirmed infection (UTI) and some, though not all, systemic signs of inflammation, the diagnosis of sepsis could be considered, especially since the patient is being treated for an infection and has received blood transfusions, which might be part of managing sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. However, the overall clinical picture provided does not unequivocally confirm sepsis, particularly without more pronounced systemic signs of infection or organ dysfunction. Nonetheless, given the context of a UTI and the patient's clinical management, it seems plausible to consider sepsis in the differential diagnosis, leaning towards its possibility due to the presence of an infection and some indicators of a systemic response, even if not all criteria for sepsis are fully met based on the information provided.",False,"The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection (UTI), and the urine analysis shows many bacteria and a positive nitrite test, indicating a bacterial infection.

Additionally, the patient has a slightly elevated temperature (tmax: 37.4°C), and an elevated white blood cell count (wbc: 9.5 and 7.0 k/ul) with a left shift (neuts: 72.0%), which are signs of infection. However, the lactic acid level is not significantly elevated (0.9 mmol/l), which is an important marker for sepsis. The patient's condition, including the use of vasopressors (heparin sodium and metoprolol) and the presence of a confirmed pulmonary embolism (pe confirmed on final chest ct report), complicates the diagnosis. Despite these factors, the presence of infection signs (elevated wbc, use of antibiotics) and organ dysfunction (indicated by the need for ICU care, ventilator support, and hemodynamic monitoring) leans towards a diagnosis of sepsis.",False,"The patient has a high WBC count, and the differential shows a high percentage of neutrophils. The patient is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which could suggest sepsis. However, there is no clear evidence of a source of infection or organ dysfunction.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing episodes of desaturation, which could indicate respiratory distress, a common feature of sepsis. The presence of sinus tachycardia and the requirement for oxygen therapy via a face tent also support the possibility of sepsis. However, the patient's blood pressure (bp: 110/58 mmHg) is not significantly low, which is an important criterion for diagnosing septic shock, a severe form of sepsis. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (levaquin), which could indicate a suspected or confirmed infection, a key component of sepsis. Despite these findings, without clear evidence of organ dysfunction or a definitive source of infection, the diagnosis of sepsis is not conclusively established based on the provided information.

The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.0 k/ul and the patient's clinical presentation of hypoxia and hypercarbia support the diagnosis of sepsis. Additionally, the patient has been given antibiotics and has a history of recent surgery, which increases the risk for sepsis. The use of enoxaparin (lovenox) and furosemide (lasix) suggests efforts to manage potential sepsis-related complications such as thrombosis and fluid overload. However, the temperature is within normal limits (37°C or 98.6°F), which might argue against sepsis, but it does not rule it out as sepsis can present with normothermia or hypothermia, especially in the elderly.

   after GI bleed.",True,"The patient's presentation includes several indicators that could suggest sepsis, such as the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), the presence of a central line, and the performance of diagnostic paracentesis, which may indicate an attempt to identify or manage a potential source of infection. Additionally, the patient is on vasopressor support (as evidenced by the use of medications like octreotide, although typically used for GI bleeding, and the mention of fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring), and has been receiving IV fluids, which can be indicative of septic shock management. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 67 bpm, which is within a relatively normal range but can be considered tachycardic in some contexts, and a blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg, which could indicate hypotension, a key feature of septic shock. The respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and ventilator settings also suggests severe illness. Laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.0 k/ul, which is not dramatically elevated but could be consistent with early sepsis or a response to infection, and a lactic acid level of 1.4 mmol/l, which is mildly elevated and can be seen in sepsis. However, the temperature is not significantly elevated (36.7°C and 36.4°C), which might argue against sepsis, but sepsis can present without fever, especially in the elderly or immunocompromised. The presence of ascites and the results of the peritoneal fluid gram stain and culture pending suggest a possible abdominal source of infection. Considering these factors, while not all criteria for sepsis are unequivocally met (e.g., significant fever is absent, and WBC is not markedly elevated), the overall clinical picture, including the use of antibiotics, potential source of infection, and signs of organ dysfunction (e.g., elevated creatinine, use of vasopressors), leans towards a diagnosis of sepsis.",False,"The patient has a high white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.0 k/ul, but this is not significantly elevated. The patient is on antibiotics, which could indicate a suspicion of sepsis. However, the absence of fever, hypotension, or organ dysfunction makes sepsis less likely.

However, without clear evidence of a source of infection or a positive blood culture, the diagnosis of sepsis is not definitive.

However, the patient is on antibiotics, which suggests that there is an ongoing infection being treated. The presence of a large hematoma at the groin incision site could be a source of infection. Additionally, the patient's hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output (co: 4.8 l/min) and cardiac index (ci: 2.2 l/min/m2) are being closely monitored, and the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) indicates cardiovascular support. The mixed venous oxygen saturation (58-62%) is slightly low, which could indicate tissue hypoperfusion. While these findings suggest a critically ill patient, the presence of infection and organ dysfunction (indicated by cardiovascular support and abnormal lab values such as troponin-t: 8.39) are key components of sepsis. However, without clear evidence of organ dysfunction directly attributable to the infection (e.g., acute kidney injury, respiratory failure), the diagnosis of sepsis is not definitively confirmed. Nonetheless, given the clinical context, it is likely that the patient is at risk for sepsis or has sepsis.",False,"The patient is on antibiotics, but there is no clear evidence of sepsis, such as fever, hypotension, or elevated white blood cell count. The patient's temperature is normal (37°C), and their white blood cell count is within normal limits (8.7 k/ul)."

However, the patient's vital signs, such as a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/79 mmHg, do not strongly indicate systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria typically seen in sepsis. The white blood cell count (WBC) is within a relatively normal range (8.6 k/ul), and while there is some elevation in neutrophil percentage, other markers like lactic acid are not significantly elevated (0.8 mmol/l), which is an important indicator of tissue hypoperfusion often seen in sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F) and a heart rate of 63 bpm, which are within normal limits, but the blood pressure is slightly low at 92/56 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 11.9 g/dL, which is a sign of infection. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including gentamicin and vancomycin, which suggests that the patient is being treated for a suspected infection. However, the patient's abdominal exam is soft and non-tender, and bowel sounds are present, which argues against a severe abdominal infection. Additionally, the patient's clinical appearance is described as 'no acute distress' and 'thin', which suggests that the patient is not in severe distress. The patient's lactate level is not reported, which is an important marker for sepsis. Overall, while there are some signs of infection, such as fever and elevated WBC, the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results do not strongly suggest sepsis. Therefore, the diagnosis of sepsis is unlikely.",True,"The patient has a fever and has been receiving antibiotics, and the white blood cell count is elevated at 11.9 g/dL, suggesting a possible infectious process. However, the patient's clinical appearance is described as 'no acute distress' and 'thin', and the vital signs are relatively stable, making the diagnosis of sepsis uncertain but possible."

The patient's lactic acid level is slightly elevated at 1.2 mmol/l, which could be a sign of tissue hypoperfusion but is not conclusively high. The presence of sinus tachycardia and the patient's response to morphine for pain suggest that while the patient is ill, the clinical picture does not conclusively point to sepsis without a clear source of infection or more definitive signs of organ dysfunction.

The use of antibiotics such as vancomycin, keflex (cephalexin), and bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) suggests a suspected or confirmed bacterial infection.

However, the provided wbc count is low (3.1 k/ul), which could indicate a compromised immune response or sepsis. The patient's oxygen requirement (on nasal cannula at 3 L/min and CPAP at nighttime) and the presence of bibasilar crackles and wheezes on lung exam also support the presence of a respiratory infection.

Additionally, the patient is on antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin), which could indicate a suspected infection. However, the patient is described as afebrile (without fever), which is an important criterion often associated with sepsis. The presence of slightly coarser breath sounds at the right lung base and mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen could suggest a source of infection. Despite these findings, the overall clinical picture, including stable vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure within a relatively normal range, and normal oxygen saturation), does not strongly support overt sepsis at this moment. The diagnosis of sepsis typically requires a combination of suspected or documented infection plus a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which include two or more of the following: temperature >38°C or <36°C, heart rate >90 bpm, respiratory rate >24 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg, and WBC >12,000 cells/mm^3, <4,000 cells/mm^3, or >10% bands. While some of these criteria are met, the absence of fever and the patient being described as 'stable' overnight with no clear indication of organ dysfunction (beyond hypotension, which is being managed) makes the diagnosis less clear-cut. Given the information, the patient's condition suggests a possible infection requiring antibiotic treatment but does not unequivocally meet all criteria for sepsis as defined by current guidelines.",True,"The patient has been on antibiotics, and there's a mention of a rash and hypotension, which could be signs of sepsis. The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and the presence of bandemia (elevated band neutrophils) also support the possibility of an infectious process.

Additionally, the patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics (azithromycin, cefipime, vancomycin, and acyclovir), which could indicate a suspicion of infection. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C, which, although not significantly high, in the context of other symptoms, could be relevant. Furthermore, the patient's lab results show pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets), which can be seen in sepsis, especially in the context of a potential viral or bacterial infection. The presence of lactic acidosis (lactic acid level of 0.6 mmol/L) also supports the diagnosis of sepsis. However, the diagnosis of sepsis typically requires evidence of organ dysfunction, which, while hinted at through the patient's need for oxygen and the presence of mild icteric sclera, is not conclusively demonstrated in the provided information. Despite this, the combination of suspected infection (indicated by antibiotic use and pending cultures), systemic inflammatory response (fever, tachycardia), and potential organ dysfunction (hypoxia, mild icteric sclera) leans towards a diagnosis of sepsis.",False,"The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, and there is a concern for an infectious process, possibly viral. The presence of neutropenia, fever (tmax: 37.1°C), and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest a high suspicion for sepsis. However, the diagnosis of sepsis typically requires evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and a suspected or documented infection. Given the information, sepsis is a consideration but not conclusively diagnosed without more specific evidence of organ dysfunction or failure due to the infection."

The patient is also on antibiotics (cefipime), suggesting a suspected or confirmed infection. Additionally, the patient has a history of decreased urine output overnight, which could be a sign of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The lactic acid level is slightly elevated at 3.2 mmol/l, which can be seen in sepsis due to tissue hypoperfusion. However, the patient's temperature is not significantly elevated (tmax: 37.4°C, tcurrent: 37.1°C), and the blood pressure, although low (90/34 mmHg), does not clearly indicate septic shock without more context on fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use. The presence of sinus rhythm and clear breath sounds, along with the absence of crackles or wheezes, does not strongly suggest sepsis-related respiratory dysfunction at this moment. Considering these factors, while there are indicators that could suggest sepsis (elevated WBC, antibiotic use, decreased urine output, and slightly elevated lactic acid), the overall picture is not conclusively indicative of sepsis without more definitive signs of organ dysfunction or a clear source of infection. Thus, the diagnosis of sepsis is uncertain based on the provided information.",True,"The patient has a fever (tmax: 37.4°C), an elevated white blood cell count (15.3 k/ul), and is on antibiotics, which could suggest sepsis.

The patient's temperature is also within a relatively normal range (Tmax: 37.4 C, Tcurrent: 36.2 C). The white blood cell count (WBC) has been relatively stable (5.0, 5.8, 4.8), which does not strongly suggest an infectious process. Although the patient is on antibiotics (vancomycin, gentamicin, penicillin G potassium, clindamycin), this could be prophylactic or for a localized infection rather than sepsis. The presence of a sinus tachycardia (heart rhythm: ST) could be due to various reasons, including pain, anxiety, or dehydration, and not necessarily sepsis. The patient's overall appearance (comfortable, drowsy, arousable to voice) and the absence of significant findings on physical examination (e.g., no wheezes, crackles, murmurs, or tenderness) further argue against sepsis.

The presence of a positive tox screen for opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine, along with significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (260,000), suggests severe muscle injury, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis. The patient is also being treated for hyperkalemia and has undergone dialysis. The sputum culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus indicates a potential infectious source. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, which is slightly elevated, and a heart rate of 81 bpm. The white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 10.9 and 12.3 k/ul, indicating a potential infectious or inflammatory process. The lactic acid level is mildly elevated at 1.4 mmol/l, which can be seen in sepsis but also in other conditions such as tissue hypoperfusion or metabolic disorders. Despite these findings, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, clindamycin, and azithromycin), which suggests a suspicion of infection. However, the clinical presentation as a whole, including the lack of clear signs of organ dysfunction specifically attributable to sepsis (e.g., severe hypotension, significant alteration in mental status beyond following simple commands, or more pronounced respiratory failure), makes the diagnosis of sepsis less clear-cut based on the information provided. The presence of infection (sputum with Staph aureus) and some signs of inflammation (elevated WBC, mild lactic acidosis) are noted, but the overall clinical context, including the patient's response to treatment and the absence of explicit mention of sepsis criteria (SOFA score, etc.), leads to a cautious interpretation.
