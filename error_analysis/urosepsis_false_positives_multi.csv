 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 86 year old female with PMH of
   uncontrolled DM who presented with one day of LLQ discomfort, n/v/AMS,
   now with hypotension and likely urosepsis. CT showed multiseptated
   cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas - which is suggestive of
   serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN.  Mild left ureteral enhancement
   was also seen with surrounding inflammatory change that may represent
   ureteritis. Patient continuing to require some pressor support but is
   otherwise stable.",True,"The mention of 'mild left ureteral enhancement with surrounding inflammatory change' on the CT scan, which could represent ureteritis, along with the patient's septic presentation, suggests that the urinary tract could be the source of infection. This, combined with the overall clinical picture of sepsis, makes urosepsis a possible diagnosis. However, without a definitive urinary tract infection diagnosis (e.g., positive urine culture), it's somewhat speculative, but given the context, it's plausible."
