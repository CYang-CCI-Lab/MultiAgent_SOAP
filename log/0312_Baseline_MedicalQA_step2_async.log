The physician discusses alternative maintenance therapy strategies with the patient. The physician discusses the pros and cons of medium- or high-dose buprenorphine maintenance therapy compared with medium- or high-dose methadone therapy with the patient. Based on this abstract, which of the following is the most appropriate information for the physician to convey to the patient?\nA: Buprenorphine is 13% and 21% less effective than methadone at medium and high doses, respectively, B: Buprenorphine is a better maintenance strategy if the patient is also regularly using benzodiazepines, C: Methadone is statistically more likely to result in treatment retention, D: Neither drug is more effective than placebo, E: There is an unclear difference in efficacy between the two drugs at these doses\n</Query>\n\nThe possible answers are: A, B, C, D, E.\nFirst provide step-by-step reasoning (rationale), and then clearly state your final answer.\n\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct', 'temperature': 0.5}, 'extra_json': {'guided_json': {'properties': {'reasoning': {'description': 'Step-by-step reasoning leading to the final choice', 'title': 'Reasoning', 'type': 'string'}, 'choice': {'description': 'Final choice', 'enum': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'title': 'Choice', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['reasoning', 'choice'], 'title': 'BaselineResponse', 'type': 'object'}}}

There are no peritoneal signs. CT scan of the abdomen shows a mid-jejunal small-bowel obstruction, multiple intraperitoneal tumor deposits, and ascites.

BMT vs MMT and high-dose BMT vs placebo did not differ for benzodiazepine use.\n\nBuprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) vs methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) or placebo for treatment retention in patients with opioid use disorder \n\nComparisons*\nHigh-dose BMT vs placebo  \nNumber of Trials (n): 5 (1001)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 72% vs 40%\nRBI (95% CI): 82% (15 to 190)\nNNT (95% CI): 4 (3 to 7)\n\nMedium-dose BMT vs placebo\nNumber of Trials (n): 4 (887)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 66% vs 38%\nRBI (95% CI): 74% (6 to 187)\nNNT (95% CI): 4 (2 to 34)\n\nLow-dose BMT vs placebo\nNumber of Trials (n): 5 (1131)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 60% vs 40%\nRBI (95% CI): 50% (19 to 88)\nNNT (95% CI): 5 (4 to 10)\n\nHigh-dose BMT vs high-dose MMT \nNumber of Trials (n): 1 (134)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 5.2% vs 6.6%\nRBR (95% CI): 21% (-216 to 20)\nNNH (95% CI): Not significant\n\nMedium-dose BMT vs medium-dose MMT \nNumber of Trials (n): 7 (780)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 43% vs 48%\nRBR (95% CI): 13% (-10 to 31)\nNNH (95% CI): Not significant\n\nFlexible-dose BMT vs flexible-dose MMT \nNumber of Trials (n): 11 (1391)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 50% vs 63% \nRBR (95% CI): 17% (5 to 27)\nNNH (95% CI): 8 (5 to 25)\n\n\nLow-dose BMT vs low-dose MMT\nNumber of Trials (n): 3 (253)\nWeighted Retention Rates: 38% vs 56%\nRBR (95% CI): 33% (13 to 48)\nNNH (95% CI): 6 (4 to 17)\n\nCI = confidence interval; NNH = number needed to harm; NNT = number needed to treat; RBI = relative benefit increase; RBR = relative benefit reduction.\n*Flexible dose = dose is titrated within a broad dose range according to patient preference; low-dose BMT = 2 to 6 mg; medium-dose BMT = 7 to 15 mg; high-dose BMT = 16 mg; medium-dose MMT = 40 to 85 mg.\n\nConclusions\nIn patients with opioid use disorder, buprenorphine is more efficacious than placebo, but less efficacious than methadone therapy, for treatment retention.\nSource of funding: Australian Government Department of Health.\nStructured abstract based on: Mattick RP, Breen, C, Kimber J, Davoli M. Buprenorphine maintenance versus placebo or methadone maintenance for opioid dependence. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014;(2):CD002207. 24500948\n\nA 38-year-old woman comes to the clinic for follow-up examination. She has opioid use disorder and currently takes methadone 40 mg daily as maintenance therapy. She says the methadone is causing mild sedation that is interfering with her job. She would like to discontinue methadone maintenance therapy but is concerned about heroin relapse. She says she also takes a friend\'s valium when she is feeling "stressed out." The physician discusses alternative maintenance therapy strategies with the patient. The physician discusses the pros and cons of medium- or high-dose buprenorphine maintenance therapy compared with medium- or high-dose methadone therapy with the patient. Based on this abstract, which of the following is the most appropriate information for the physician to convey to the patient?\nA: Buprenorphine is 13% and 21% less effective than methadone at medium and high doses, respectively, B: Buprenorphine is a better maintenance strategy if the patient is also regularly using benzodiazepines, C: Methadone is statistically more likely to result in treatment retention, D: Neither drug is more effective than placebo, E: There is an unclear difference in efficacy between the two drugs at these doses\n</Query>\n\nThe possible answers are: A, B, C, D, E.\nFirst provide step-by-step reasoning (rationale), and then clearly state your final answer.\n\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct', 'temperature': 0.5}, 'extra_json': {'guided_json': {'properties': {'reasoning': {'description': 'Step-by-step reasoning leading to the final choice', 'title': 'Reasoning', 'type': 'string'}, 'choice': {'description': 'Final choice', 'enum': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'title': 'Choice', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['reasoning', 'choice'], 'title': 'BaselineResponse', 'type': 'object'}}}

She has cerebral palsy, situs inversus, and severe scoliosis. She uses a wheelchair for ambulation. During previous visits, transferring this patient from her wheelchair to the examination table has been time-consuming and has caused the patient discomfort. Today, the patient appears uncomfortable. The physician decides to conduct the examination while the patient is sitting in her wheelchair. Temperature is 38.3C (101.0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 100%. Examination shows mildly dry mucous membranes. The physician evaluated four previous patients today who had vomiting and fever; he diagnosed gastroenteritis in all four patients. The physician attributes this patient's increased pulse to mild dehydration and fever, and he diagnoses this patient with gastroenteritis. The physician prescribes ondansetron and tells the patient to return if she has intractable vomiting or if her abdominal pain worsens. Five hours later, the patient is taken to the emergency department after her mother finds her listless and barely responsive. Temperature is 38.9C (102.0F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%.
