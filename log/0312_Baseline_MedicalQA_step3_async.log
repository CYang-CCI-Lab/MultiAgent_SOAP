ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  \nAllocation: Concealed.  \nBlinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  \nFollow-up period: Up to 17 years.  \nSetting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  \nPatients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of â\x89¥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  \nIntervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

Participants are given a study-provided portable digital device and asked to maintain a daily schedule of their fibromyalgia pain and stress levels for 30 days using two well-validated and reliable self-reporting scales. Results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.05). Similarly, statistically significant relationships were found between Type A personality participants and increased stress levels (P<.01), as well as increased levels of fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.005).

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  \nAllocation: Concealed.  \nBlinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  \nFollow-up period: Up to 17 years.  \nSetting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  \nPatients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of â\x89¥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  \nIntervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  \nAllocation: Concealed.  \nBlinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  \nFollow-up period: Up to 17 years.  \nSetting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  \nPatients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of â\x89¥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  \nIntervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  \nAllocation: Concealed.  \nBlinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  \nFollow-up period: Up to 17 years.  \nSetting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  \nPatients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of â\x89¥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  \nIntervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4). Other main results are shown in the Table. \nEndoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) vs emergency portacaval shunt (EPCS) in patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices \n\nOutcomes     \nControl of bleedin g at > 30 days*: EST 20%, EPCS 100%, P value <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class A:  EST 4.62, EPCS 10.43, P value .003\nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class B:  EST 2.61, EPCS 6.19, P value  <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - (Child-Pugh risk class C:  EST 6.8, EPCS 0.4, P value <.001 \nMean number of readmissions for  varice al bleeding requiring pac ked red blood cell transfusion \nRecurrent portal -systemic encephalopathyâ\x80\xa0:  EST  35%, EPCS 15%, P value .001 \n\n*Excluding indeterminate deaths at 14 days from nonbleeding causes.\nâ\x80\xa0In patients who survived 30 days and left hospital.\n\nConclusion: In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, emergency portacaval shunt was better than endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, and survival.  \nSources of funding: National Institutes of Health and Surgical Education and Research Foundation.  \nStructured abstract based on: Orloff MJ, Isenberg JI, Wheeler HO, et al.

Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4). Other main results are shown in the Table. \nEndoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) vs emergency portacaval shunt (EPCS) in patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices \n\nOutcomes     \nControl of bleedin g at > 30 days*: EST 20%, EPCS 100%, P value <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class A:  EST 4.62, EPCS 10.43, P value .003\nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class B:  EST 2.61, EPCS 6.19, P value  <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - (Child-Pugh risk class C:  EST 6.8, EPCS 0.4, P value <.001 \nMean number of readmissions for  varice al bleeding requiring pac ked red blood cell transfusion \nRecurrent portal -systemic encephalopathyâ\x80\xa0:  EST  35%, EPCS 15%, P value .001 \n\n*Excluding indeterminate deaths at 14 days from nonbleeding causes.\nâ\x80\xa0In patients who survived 30 days and left hospital.\n\nConclusion: In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, emergency portacaval shunt was better than endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, and survival.  \nSources of funding: National Institutes of Health and Surgical Education and Research Foundation.  \nStructured abstract based on: Orloff MJ, Isenberg JI, Wheeler HO, et al.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.  \nAllocation: Concealed.  \nBlinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).  \nFollow-up period: Up to 17 years.  \nSetting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.  \nPatients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of â\x89¥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.  \nIntervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.  \nOutcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.  Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).  \nMain results \n15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4). Other main results are shown in the Table. \nEndoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) vs emergency portacaval shunt (EPCS) in patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices \n\nOutcomes     \nControl of bleedin g at > 30 days*: EST 20%, EPCS 100%, P value <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class A:  EST 4.62, EPCS 10.43, P value .003\nMedian survival (years) - Child-Pugh risk class B:  EST 2.61, EPCS 6.19, P value  <.001 \nMedian survival (years) - (Child-Pugh risk class C:  EST 6.8, EPCS 0.4, P value <.001 \nMean number of readmissions for  varice al bleeding requiring pac ked red blood cell transfusion \nRecurrent portal -systemic encephalopathyâ\x80\xa0:  EST  35%, EPCS 15%, P value .001 \n\n*Excluding indeterminate deaths at 14 days from nonbleeding causes.\nâ\x80\xa0In patients who survived 30 days and left hospital.\n\nConclusion: In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, emergency portacaval shunt was better than endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, and survival.  \nSources of funding: National Institutes of Health and Surgical Education and Research Foundation.  \nStructured abstract based on: Orloff MJ, Isenberg JI, Wheeler HO, et al.
