cxr [**2155-4-16**]:
findings: portable ap chest radiograph compared with [**2155-4-11**]
demonstrates
interval increase in bilateral basal and perihilar airspace
opacities with
increase in bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left
and fluid
tracking along the minor fissure. a left chest two-lead
pacemaker remains
stable in appearance. there is a feeding tube with its tip
positioned in the third portion of the duodenum.

tte [**2155-4-17**]: the left atrium is dilated. left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (lvef >55%). right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. the number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. the aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
there is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve
prolapse. there is severe mitral annular calcification. there is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. there is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmhg) due to mitral
annular calcification. moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated.]
the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no
pericardial effusion.

renal us [**2155-4-17**]:
impression:
1. progression of the abnormal appearance of renal transplant
vascularity,
now with diffuse reversal of flow in diastole. renal vein
remains patent.
2. no significant change in appearance of the large midline/left

abdominopelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma.

ct chest w/o constrast [**2155-4-17**]:
impression:
1. bilateral lower lobe consolidations concerning for pneumonia
in the
setting of fever.
2. asymmetrically distributed ground-glass opacities and smooth
septal
thickening, most likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
infectious
etiology (such as viral) for these opacities is less likely.
3. small, dependent left and small-to-moderate, partially
loculated right
pleural effusion.

colonoscopy [**2155-4-26**]:
friability and ulceration in the distal transverse colon,
splenic flexure and proximal descending colon compatible with
ischemic colitis
normal mucosa in the hepatic flexure and distal ascending colon
otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

egd [**2155-4-26**]:
normal esophagus.  normal stomach.  normal duodenum.




brief hospital course:
ms. [**known lastname **] was evaluated in the ed and thought to have
pulmonary edema. due to her high oxygen requirement and clinical
picture, she was given iv [**known lastname 11573**] with minimal response. she was
admitted to the sicu where [**known lastname 11573**] [**known lastname **] was initiated. below is
her hospital course by system:

1. neurologic: mental status improved by hospital day 2.
confusion was felt to be secondary to hypoxia and uti. psych
meds were continued. she was noted to have tremor and weakness
on her right side. neurology was consulted and made
recommendations for  eeg to r/o seizures, head ct to eval
evolution of stroke. keppra was continued at current dose. head
ct without contrast on [**4-22**] demonstrated unchanged left frontal
parafalcine dural calcification. no mass effect, bleed or
midline shift. mild atrophy was noted. cpap was recommended to
decrease change of hypoxia that could increase seizure
potential. this was set up, but she refused to wear due to
claustraphobia sensation.

2. pulmonary: pulmonary edema responded to diuresis. chest ct
was done on [**4-17**] demonstrating pulmonary edema with possible
bilateral pneumonia. cardiology consult was obtained and it was
deemed that she had chf secondary to worsening mr. [**first name (titles) 11573**] [**last name (titles) **]
and metolazone were given. she was also treated with a
7-day-course of vancomycin for pna.

3. cardiac: due to her history of diastolic chf and a bnp of
~10,000 at admission, patient was thought to be in chf which
exacerbated her [**last name (un) **]. tte on [**2155-4-17**] showed normal lvef with
worsening mr compared to previous tte on 2/[**2155**]. cardiology
agreed with the plan. recommendations were to continue to
diurese then re-echo to evaluate mr and as once euvolemic.

4. gi: dobbhoff tube was clogged on admission and was exchanged
on hd#1. tf was restarted to 40 ml/hr of norvasource with
beniprotein 21g/day. she developed diarrhea likely r/t tube
feeds. stool was negative for c.diff on [**4-24**] and [**4-26**].
colchicine which was started [**4-21**] was likely causing diarrhea.
on hd 10 the patient passed multiple clots per rectum and had a
hct drop. she was transferred to the icu and was transfused 6
units of ffp and 6 units of prbc's. her hct stabalized at 30 and
she did not require any further transfusions after hd 12. a
colonoscopy done on [**4-26**] was significant for friability and
ulceration in the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure and
proximal descending colon compatible with ischemic colitis. tube
feedings were stopped allowing for bowel rest. on [**4-29**],
hepatology was consulted to place post pyloric feeding tube. on
[**5-1**] a feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were advanced
slowly during the remainder of her stay. at the time of
discharge her tube feeds were to goal. peptamen 1.5 3/4 strength
@ 60cc/hr. she should continue daily calorie counts.

5. gu: diuresed with furosemide, metolazone and chlorothiazide.
creatinine was 1.7 on admit. this trended down to 1.1 but
trended up again to 1.9 after the lgi bleed. at the time of
discharge her cr was at baseline.

6. hem/id: on admit wbc was 35k with fever of 102.4. she was
treated on meropenem for esbl klebsiella uti from her ucx on
[**4-12**]. meropenum was given from [**4-17**] thru [**4-22**]. vancomycin was
added empirically and given for 6 days ([**4-17**] thru [**4-22**]) for
presumed pneumonia. serum wbc trended down to 16. blood cultures
from [**4-16**] were negative. as discussed above her hct dropped [**3-12**] a
lower gi bleed and stabalized after multiple transfussions.
cipro and flagyl were started and should complete a 14 day
course.

7. musculoskeletal: she complained of increased discomfort in
wrists. rheumatology was consulted and felt that she likely had
a gout flare. recommendations were to increase her prednisone to
10mg per day and start colchicine daily. joint pain decreased.
prednisone was tapered to 5mg daily. colchicine was stopped due
to an increase in her cr, therefore prednisone was increased to
10 mg daily with good effect

8. immunosuppression: prograf levels were monitored closely
during this admission. dosing based on levels. mmf was kept at
500 [**hospital1 **] and prednisone dosing as discussed under ms is 10 mg at
discharge.

evolving sepsis. his knee had been replaced ~7 years ago and
recently there had been concern about evolving infection due to
knee pain x 1 month leading to several joint taps, last reported
tap 2 days ago. he was started on daptomycin on [**4-10**] for mrsa
septic arthritis and meropenem was added on [**4-13**], reports
allergy to vancomycin. he had a midline placed on [**4-19**]. he was

transthoracic echocardiogram ([**4-24**]):
the left atrium is markedly dilated. the right atrium is
moderately dilated. there is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. overall left ventricular
function is normal. due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. tissue doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(pcwp<12mmhg). the right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. there is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. the ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. there are three aortic valve leaflets. the aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. there is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is
no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial effusion.
impression: suboptimal image quality. mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. evidence of right ventricular
volume/pressure overload. at least mild pulmonary hypertension,
which may be underestimated.

ct chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**4-25**]):
1. multiloculated simple-appearing left pleural effusion with
adjacent regions of lung collapse as described above. underlying
infection within these regions of collapse as well as empyema
cannot be excluded on this non-contrast examination.
additionally mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema with
probable underlying tracheal and proximal bronchial malacia.
2. calcified and non-calcified pleural plaques consistent with
underlying asbestos exposure. no parenchymal findings to suggest
underlying asbestosis. given the involvement of the medial
pleural surface on the left as well as some regions of
underlying nodularity, a dedicated biopsy and/or vats
examination would be of benefit to exclude underlying
mesothelioma if a contrast enhanced exam can not be performed.
3. extensive atherosclerotic calcification with 2.6cm of focal
region of ulceration involving the inferior aspect of the aortic
arch.
4. colitis involving the residual left-sided colon. most likely
infectious or inflammatory with ischemia felt less likely.
5. known underlying sequelae of cirrhosis with mild-to-moderate
intra-abdominal ascites.
6. large fecal load noted within the right and transverse colon.
fecalized matter within the stomach may suggest underlying
gastroparesis and/or severe ileus.
7. fluid-filled distended esophagus also likely related to
underlying dysmotility. can consider further evaluation with
dedicated esophogram when clinically feasible.
8. cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
9. large sacral decubitus ulcer with extension to involve the
inferior sacrum and coccyx which display demineralization and
destruction of the cortex consistent with osteomyelitis.
10. vertebra plana deformity involving t11 vertebral body likley
related to prior infection and/or trauma. if there is clinical
concern for an acute spondylitis, a dedicated mri examination
could be obtained. gadolinium should be used if patient's gfr
allows.

brief hospital course:
# septic arthritis
he had an mrsa infection of the left knee prosthetic joint, s/p
washout on [**2105-4-23**]. gram stain was negative for organisms and
showed many pmns. id was following and recommended for a 6-week
course of daptomycin (dosed after hd) and rifampin (last dose on
[**2105-6-3**]) and will likely require long-term suppresion after if
prosthesis not removed. if pt has prosthesis removed, he will no
longer require rifampin; please be aware of med interaction when
starting and stopping rifampin. he should be followed by the
infectious disease specialist at [**hospital1 **] (our id fellow will
contact with more info), and he will need weekly monitoring of
ck (daptomycin) and cbc, ast, alt, and ck (rifampin). morphine
was used for post-operative pain and pain related to infection.
he should continue physical therapy.

# hospital acquired pneumonia and respiratory status
his sputum grew out gram negative rods and he completed an 8-day
course of ceftazidime and tobramycin with the last dose given on
[**2105-5-4**]. during the course of the admission, possibly in part due
to morphine given for knee pain, he was noted to be somnulent
with abgs indicative of hypercarbia. cxr showed white out of the
left lung on two separate occasions, presumably due to mucuous
plugging because follow-up cxrs improved after chest pt and
positive pressure ventilation. a ct chest was done during the
admission. this showed multiloculated simple-appearing left
pleural effusion with adjacent regions of lung collapse (see
full report above). this should be followed up in a 3 months
with repeat ct to assess for improvement in the effusion after
his pneumonia is treated.  he required intermittent ventilator
support at baseline at night.

# end-stage renal disease on hemodialyisis
he was continued on m-w-f hemodialysis schedule.

# hypotension
he required dopamine drip transiently. [**last name (un) **] stim test was
normal. we were unsure of the cause for his hypotension, but
felt that it may be due to sepsis from knee infection versus
fluid removal from hemodialysis. dopamine drip was turned off
several days prior to discharge. pt able to tolerate low dose
metoprolol at time of discharge for rate control.

# history of gastrointestinal bleeding
we held anticoagulation and continued his home proton-pump
inhibitor.

# sacral decrubitus ulcer
he underwent ct torso that showed sacral osteomyelitis. wound
care service was following and recommended for v.a.c. therapy
dressing changed monday and thursday @ 125 mmhg in addition to
the following: pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines,
turn and reposition every 1-2 hours, heels off bed surface at
all times, waffle boots bilaterally, elevate legs while sitting,
moisturize bilateral legs and feet twice daily, commerical wound
cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse open wound, pat
the tissue dry with dry gauze, apply protective barrier wipe to
peri-wound tissue and air dry, cover with soft sorb dressing,
secure with medipore tape, change dressing daily.

# coronary artery disease
there was no evidence of ischemia during this admission with an
unremarkable ecg and no complaints of chest pain, ck normal. his
troponin was elevated most likely due to end-stage renal
disease. we continued his home aspirin. a tte showed severe tr
with a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.

# history of seizure disorder
we continued his home keppra at a dose adjusted for end-stage
renal disease.

# constipation
there was increasing abdominal distention noted on exam and a ct
torso showed impacted stool so he was given a saline enema
through his ostomy with a resultant large amount of stool
output. of note, he was receiving saline enema through ostomy q3
days at rehab with good results. he was continued on docusate,
lactulose, and senna.

# atrial fibrillation
this is chronic, and he is not on anticoagulation due to history
of gastrointestinal bleed. he was initially tachycardic to the
low 100s; this improved with iv hydration. beta-blocker was
added for rate control.

# access
a picc line has been placed for antibiotics, in addition to
which he has a tunneled right subclavian for hd.

# code status
his code status is full code, with family agreeing to only one
shock in the event of cardiac arrest.

of trachea, and upsizing of her trach to a #7
[**2156-8-9**]: rigid bronch, t-tube placement
l-picc placement

history of present illness:
txfer from [**hospital3 3583**]
in [**1-30**], patient was difficult to extubate s/p cabg and required
a tracheostomy. she was subsequently sent to pulmonary rehab.
.
she was referred to dr. [**last name (stitle) **] in [**6-25**] who performed a rigid
bronchoscopy here followed by replacement of her tracheostomy
tube. she was found to have a circumferential area of stenosis
below the cricoid cartilage extending 6cm; it was not felt to be
granulation tissue. debridement was minimally successful. a ct
scan was done which showed that she had:
-focal tracheal stenosis at the inferior extent of the
tracheostomy tube.
-there was also: proximal narrowing which may relate to
granulation tissue versus secretions.
-polypoid soft tissue density just above the insertion of the
tracheostomy tube may relate to granulation tissue.
.
- she was discharged back to rehab
.
on [**2156-7-4**], she was then admitted to [**hospital3 **] with sob
and desatted to the low 90s. she was given o2, suctioning and
nebulizers without significant improvement. initially, she was
started on levoquin and finished a 14 day course for suspected
bronchitis. her respiratatory status improved and hence she did
not require ventilation.
.
she was found on hod #2 to have enterococcus bacteremia - via cx
x 2 on [**7-4**] and cx x 2 on [**7-5**]. (a tte was negative for
vegetations. a tee was not performed). as such, she was started
on vancomycin with subsequent negative surveillance cultures.
.
[**7-8**]: id was consulted. they added on gent once her urine
culture came back positive for klebsiella uti. this particular
klebsiella uti was only sensitive to gentamicin, imipenem, zosyn
and cefotetan.
- started on imipenem on [**2156-7-24**] for this.
.
on [**7-19**], she was obtunded and had significant mucous secretions
and mucus plugging requiring suctioning; ent changed her
cuffless trach from a #6 to a #4 and transitioned to a trach
collar after transient ventilation.
.
on [**7-19**], she has a ij tlc placed in or at [**hospital1 46**].
on [**7-22**], noticed to have ""mild stridor"" and mild tachypnea and
was replaced on a ventilator.
.
of note:
- was found to be c diff + and was started on flagyl
.
today, she is transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for further options regarding
placement of a new tracheostomy tube.

brief hospital course:
67 yo female with history of tracheobronchomalacia transferred
from osh for further management.
micu course: pt followed by ip, tracheomalacia c/w subglottic
granulation tissue and mid trach stenosis. s/p rigid bronch +
excision, debridement, dilatation and trach change. she was
managed for acinobacter/klebsiella vap, +c-diff and followed by
id. tee negative for vegetations. pt back to micu on [**8-3**] for
aggressive fluid resuscitation given c-diff colitis and poor po
intake with metabolic acidosis. was given ivf w/bicarb, [**doctor first name **]
following but not surgical candidate given comorbidities,
started ivflagyl/po vanco with slowly improving diarrhea. on
[**8-3**] went into raf, s/p cv now in nsr remains stable.
transferred to floor [**8-6**].
.
# respiratory:
**tracheomalacia: this was noted on previous admission to [**hospital1 18**].

- s/p laser removal of tissue x 2 in the past
- on [**7-28**]: was switched from vent to trach mask and tolerated
this well
- on [**7-30**]: had rigid [**last name (un) 1066**], electrocautery and balloon dilatation
of trachea and upsizing of her trach to a #7 -> will need a
special long trach which was ordered and will be available on
[**8-9**]. per ip underwent a trach change with t-tube placement on
[**8-9**] without complications. her trach was capped with stable
o2sats and voice audible. per ip her trach is to be capped
during the day and with humidified o2 at night for her osa. if
pt needs oxygenation she can be oxygenated with nasal cannula o2
with capped trach.
.
**acinobacter/klebsiella vap: started bactrim on [**7-28**], completed
14 day course on [**8-10**]
-- continue mucinex prn mucus buildup
-- d/cd atrovent, albuterol standing nebs
-- pt was on solumedrol 60 iv bid prior to admission (unclear
reason why, ? copd flare), and pt was started on taper on [**2156-7-25**]
and completed taper without any difficulties
.
# id:  pt had hx of enteroccus bacteremia, which was believed to
be treated adequately with 23 day course of vanc at osh.  she
had a tee here, which was negative for vegetation, per id
recommendations the vanc was d/c'd. surveillance cx's were ngtd.
 pt grew acinetobacter from her sputum, and was started on
bactrim on [**7-28**] for 14 day course for vent associated pna.  pt
also had hx of klebsiella uti, and had been treated with
imipenem at osh. per id recommendations, pt was likely colonized
from frequent foley catheterizations, and imipenem was d/c'd. pt
had dirty ua on admission here, but urine cx only grew yeast.
attempted to contact [**name (ni) 336**] to obtain records of antimicrobial
succeptibilities of sternal infections and bacteremias in past.
sternal wound infection was staph and proteus per surgical
summary. however, they did not send the micro data, so will need
to call the micro lab at some point in the future for further
information.  pt had hx of c.dif, and was continued on flagyl
for additional 14 day course. pt had low grade temps during her
micu stay (with a tmax of 100.5), but did not have a significant
temp spike. she then had explosive diarrhea with +c-diff in
stools. she had persistent diarrhea, resistent to po flagyl
treatment, she was started on po vanco as well as iv flagyl on
[**8-2**] for c-diff colitis. id again reconsulted for persistent
diarrhea and elevated wbc. her diarrhea improved with po vanco
and ivflagyl, her wbc peaked at 29 and came down to 14.4 at time
of discharge. she was also started on meropenem on [**8-3**] for
klebsiella uti. per id she was to continue po vanco/flagyl until
all other antibiotics d/c'd and diarrhea improved. she remained
afebrile with improving wbc and no new culture data. she will
complete a recommended 10day course of meropenem on [**2156-8-12**]. she
remained afebrile with improving wbc and no new culture data at
time of discharge.
.
#. c-diff colitis: pt with explosive diarrhea treated for c-diff
as noted above. she was followed closely by surgery, however
given her other comorbidities she was not a surgical candidate.
she was followed with daily kubs, her last kub notable for
improvement in loops of bowel size. however, notable for small
bowel obstruction on [**2156-8-4**]. pt was kept on a clear liquid diet
with plan to advance when improved colities. her stool output
improved at time of discharge. continued c-diff precuations.
.
# neuro:
seizure prophylaxis
- on phenytoin (likely since she had subdural sustained in [**4-29**])

- continued phenytoin during this admission, increased dose
given low albumin and subtherapeutic with corrected dose.
changed dose from 200mgqam to 300mg qam and increased 300mg qpm
to 400mgqpm. she did not have any siezure activity while
hospitalized.
- ct from osh revealed mass in supracisternal region on r and
patient notes that she has had changes in vision in her r eye -
specificially she notes seeing random objects since her fall. pt
had r homonymous hemianopsia and was to follow up with
neuroopthamology.
- [**7-29**]: contact[**name (ni) **] dr. [**first name4 (namepattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 21721**] (endocrine at [**hospital1 112**]) regarding
her pituitary tumor.  restarted her on carbergoline for her
prolactinoma. per dr. [**last name (stitle) 21721**] should reckeck prolactin levels in
6 weeks since prolactin levels elevated during this admission.
plan to continue cabergoline at current dose 0.5mg 2x/week. if
her prolactin levels are persistently elevated may increase dose
0.75mg 2x/week.
- pituitary tumor is a prolactinoma and measures approx 5cm x
2.5cm x 3cm
.
# renal:
- cr 1.5 on admission; this is similar to level when she left
[**hospital1 46**]
- renally dose medications -> increaed cr on [**7-31**] with peak to
2.4 due to poor po intake and explosive diarrhea. renal followed
pt, found no muddy brown casts, arf c/w prerenal etiology also
atn in setting of poor forward flow. she was agressively
hydrated in the micu with addition of 50meq nahco3. her arf
improved with cr. decreased to 1.6 at time of discharge. her ivf
were discontinued on [**8-9**] as she was significantly volume
overloaded and making urine, although poorly ~700cc per day.
.
#. metabolic acidosis: pt with explosive diarrhea with low
bicarb. she was started on 50meq nahco3w/1000ml 1/2ns to manage
metabolic acidosis. her hco3 improved, her hypernatremia
corrected. however, she also developed hyponatremia with ivf
resuscitation. her ivf were d/c'd on [**8-9**], her hco3 at time of
discharge was 19.
.
# cardio:  pt s/p cabg in the past, she also went into aflutter
for which she was cardioverted on [**8-3**]. she remained in nsr. she
did not tolerate a bb throughout her hospital course due to
hypotension. she was continued on an asa and statin. no other
antihypertensive medication was added to her medical regimen.
her sbp was stable at time of discharge sbp 115. d/c'd hctz
during this admission, due to borderline low bp and likely need
for bb in the future
.
# dm2:  her bs was persistently elevated while she was on
steroids. she was maintained on an iss which was titrated for
better bs control. check fs qid
.
# gerd: continued ppi
.
# [**month/year (2) **]:  ppi, fondaparinaux for dvt [**name (ni) **] (pt has hx of hit).
however fondaparinaux was held prior to ip procedure, but was
restarted s/p procedure.  head of bed at 30 degress
.
# fen:  pt grossly volume overloaded. allow pt to autodierese
and holding further ivf. currenlty receiving tpn since poor po
intake; clear liquid diet until colitis improved. note on [**7-29**]:
had fees study by speech/swallow team -> ok to have nectar thick
liquids and ground solids, however changed diet to clear liq due
to colitis. will need a new nutrition evaluation at [**hospital1 3325**] to advance diet.
.
# access: l subclavian - placed in or on [**7-19**] at [**hospital3 **]

- removed on [**7-26**] with no growth on culture data
- switched picc on [**7-29**] because patient has hit. hence switched
to [**last name (un) 68151**] picc which does not require heparin.
