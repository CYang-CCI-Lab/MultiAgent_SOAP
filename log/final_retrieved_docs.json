[**4-26**].\ncolchicine which was started [**4-21**] was likely causing diarrhea.\non hd 10 the patient passed multiple clots per rectum and had a\nhct drop. she was transferred to the icu and was transfused 6\nunits of ffp and 6 units of prbc's. her hct stabalized at 30 and\nshe did not require any further transfusions after hd 12. a\ncolonoscopy done on [**4-26**] was significant for friability and\nulceration in the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure and\nproximal descending colon compatible with ischemic colitis. tube\nfeedings were stopped allowing for bowel rest. on [**4-29**],\nhepatology was consulted to place post pyloric feeding tube. on\n[**5-1**] a feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were advanced\nslowly during the remainder of her stay. at the time of\ndischarge her tube feeds were to goal. peptamen 1.5 3/4 strength\n@ 60cc/hr. she should continue daily calorie counts.\n\n5. gu: diuresed with furosemide, metolazone and

was 35k with fever of 102.4. she was\ntreated on meropenem for esbl klebsiella uti from her ucx on\n[**4-12**]. meropenum was given from [**4-17**] thru [**4-22**]. vancomycin was\nadded empirically and given for 6 days ([**4-17**] thru [**4-22**]) for\npresumed pneumonia. serum wbc trended down to 16. blood cultures\nfrom [**4-16**] were negative. as discussed above her hct dropped [**3-12**] a\nlower gi bleed and stabalized after multiple transfussions.\ncipro and flagyl were started and should complete a 14 day\ncourse.\n\n7. musculoskeletal: she complained of increased discomfort in\nwrists. rheumatology was consulted and felt that she likely had\na gout flare. recommendations were to increase her prednisone to\n10mg per day and start colchicine daily. joint pain decreased.\nprednisone was tapered to 5mg daily. colchicine was stopped due\nto an increase in her cr, therefore prednisone was increased to\n10 mg daily with good effect\n\n8. immunosuppression: prograf levels were monitored closely\nduring this admission. dosing based on levels. mmf was kept at\n500 [**hospital1 **] and prednisone dosing as discussed under ms is 10 mg

mrsa infection of the left knee prosthetic joint, s/p\nwashout on [**2105-4-23**]. gram stain was negative for organisms and\nshowed many pmns. id was following and recommended for a 6-week\ncourse of daptomycin (dosed after hd) and rifampin (last dose on\n[**2105-6-3**]) and will likely require long-term suppresion after if\nprosthesis not removed. if pt has prosthesis removed, he will no\nlonger require rifampin; please be aware of med interaction when\nstarting and stopping rifampin. he should be followed by the\ninfectious disease specialist at [**hospital1 **] (our id fellow will\ncontact with more info), and he will need weekly monitoring of\nck (daptomycin) and cbc, ast, alt, and ck (rifampin). morphine\nwas used for post-operative pain and pain related to infection.\nhe should continue physical therapy.\n\n# hospital acquired pneumonia and respiratory status\nhis sputum grew out gram negative rods and he completed an 8-day\ncourse of ceftazidime and tobramycin with the last dose given on\n[**2105-5-4**]. during the course of the admission, possibly in part due\nto morphine given for knee pain, he was noted to be somnulent\nwith abgs indicative of hypercarbia. cxr showed white out of the\nleft lung on two separate occasions, presumably due to mucuous\nplugging because follow-up cxrs improved after chest pt and\npositive pressure ventilation. a ct chest was done during the\nadmission. this showed multiloculated simple-appearing left\npleural effusion with adjacent regions of lung collapse (see\nfull report above). this should be followed up in a 3 months\nwith repeat ct to assess for improvement in the effusion after\nhis pneumonia is treated.  he required intermittent ventilator\nsupport at baseline at night.\n\n# end-stage renal disease on hemodialyisis\nhe was continued on m-w-f hemodialysis schedule.\n\n# hypotension\nhe required dopamine drip transiently. [**last name (un) **] stim test was\nnormal. we were unsure of the cause for his hypotension, but\nfelt that it may be due to sepsis from knee infection versus\nfluid removal from hemodialysis. dopamine drip was turned off\nseveral days prior to discharge. pt able to tolerate low dose\nmetoprolol at time of discharge for rate control.\n\n# history of gastrointestinal bleeding\nwe held anticoagulation and continued his home proton-pump\ninhibitor.\n\n# sacral decrubitus ulcer\nhe underwent ct torso that showed sacral osteomyelitis. wound\ncare service was following and recommended for v.a.c. therapy\ndressing changed monday and thursday @ 125 mmhg in addition to\nthe following: pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines,\nturn and reposition every 1-2 hours, heels off bed surface at\nall times, waffle boots bilaterally, elevate legs while sitting,\nmoisturize bilateral legs and feet twice daily, commerical wound\ncleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse open wound, pat\nthe tissue dry with dry gauze, apply protective barrier wipe to\nperi-wound tissue and air dry, cover with soft sorb dressing,\nsecure with medipore tape, change dressing daily.\n\n# coronary artery disease\nthere was no evidence of ischemia during this admission with an\nunremarkable ecg and no complaints of chest pain, ck normal. his\ntroponin was elevated most likely due to end-stage renal\ndisease. we continued his home aspirin. a tte showed severe tr\nwith a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.\n\n# history of seizure disorder\nwe continued his home keppra at a dose adjusted for end-stage\nrenal disease.\n\n# constipation\nthere was increasing abdominal distention noted on exam and a ct\ntorso showed impacted stool so he was given a saline enema\nthrough his ostomy with a resultant large amount of stool\noutput. of note, he was receiving saline enema through ostomy q3\ndays at rehab with good results. he was continued on docusate,\nlactulose, and senna.\n\n# atrial fibrillation\nthis is chronic, and he is not on anticoagulation due to history\nof gastrointestinal bleed. he was initially tachycardic to the\nlow 100s; this improved with iv hydration. beta-blocker was\nadded for rate control.\n\n# access\na picc line has been placed for antibiotics, in addition to\nwhich he has a tunneled right subclavian for hd.\n\n# code status\nhis code status is full code, with family agreeing to only one\nshock in the event of cardiac arrest.\n\nmedications on admission:\nmeropenem 1g [**hospital1 **](since [**4-13**])\ndaptomycin 350mg mwf(since [**4-10**])\nallopurinol 100mg mwf\ncelecoxib 100mg po bid\nchlorhexidine qid\nsucralfate 1gm po tid\nthiamine 100mg daily\ntobramycin 300mg/5ml solution nebulizer [**hospital1 **]\nacetaminophen 650mg q4 hours\nlactulose 30ml [**hospital1 **]\noxycodone 5mg po daily prn\nmiconazole powder daily to feet\nmidodrine 10mg tid\nmirtazapine 7.5mg qhs\nnephplex caps daily (= nephrocaps)\npantoprazole 40mg daily\npregabalin 75mg daily\nquetiapine 12.5 daily\ndarbepoetin 200mcg wendesdays\ndocusate 100mg [**hospital1 **]\nescitalopram 15mg qhs\nferrous sulfate 325mg [**hospital1 **]\nfolic acid 1mg daily\nlevetiracetam 1000mg [**hospital1 **]\n\ndischarge medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet, chewable\npo daily (daily).\n2. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a\nday).\n3. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours).\n4. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2\ntimes a day).\n5. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\n\n6. thiamine hcl 100 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\n(daily).\n7. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q6h (every 6\nhours) as needed for pain, fever.\n8. morphine 1 mg/ml syringe sig: [**1-2**]  injection every six (6)\nhours as needed for pain.\n9. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) adhesive patch, medicated sig:\none (1) adhesive patch, medicated topical daily (daily): 12\nhours on- 12 hours off.\n10. levetiracetam 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\n(daily): please give after hd on hd days.\n11. lactulose 10 gram/15 ml syrup sig: thirty (30) ml po qid (4\ntimes a day).\n12. daptomycin 500 mg recon soln sig: one (1) recon soln\nintravenous q48h (every 48 hours): to be given for six weeks\nwith start date [**2105-4-23**]. please dose after hd.\n13. rifampin 300 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po q12h (every\n12 hours): to be given for six weeks with start date [**2105-4-23**].\n14. outpatient lab work\nplease check cbc, ast, alt, ck qmonday\n15. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid\n(2 times a day).\n16. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid\nw/meals (3 times a day with meals).\n\n\ndischarge disposition:\nextended care\n\nfacility:\n[**hospital3 7**] & rehab center - [**hospital1 8**]\n\n\nDischarge Diagnosis: \nprimary diagnoses\nsepsis\nseptic left knee\nright knee effusion\npneumonia\n\nsecondary diagnoses\nrespiratory failure with trachestomy, vent-depedent at night\nend-stage renal disease on hemodialysis monday, wednesday,\nfriday\nhypertension\ncoronary artery disease\ncongestive heart failure\natrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated due to gi bleed history\ncolon cancer and bowel obstruction s/p resection, now with\nostomy\n\n\ndischarge condition:\nstable\n\n\ndischarge instructions:\nyou were admitted to the hospital for treatment of infected knee\nand sepsis related to infection. you have been treated with\nantibiotics for the infected knee and for pneumonia. please\ncontinue the antibiotics as directed.\n\nplease follow up with your pcp as well as the id specialist at\n[**hospital1 **]. you will need weekly laboratory checks while on\nantibiotics. we also recommend that you have a follow-up ct in 3\nmonths to evaluate for resolution of pneumonia and fluid seen in\nthe lungs on the ct during this admission.\n\nplease call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you\nhave worsening of knee pain, fevers, worsening breathing, or\nother concerning symptoms.\n\nfollowup instructions:\nplease have a follow-up chest ct scan to evaluate resolution of\neffusion and evaluation of pleural plaques\n\nplease have weekly labs drawn while on antibiotics\n\n\n\n",
