of\nanoxic brain injury, chronic kidney disease, anxiety, and\ndepression who presents with altered mental status.\n\n# altered mental status: when patient arrived in the icu after\ntransfer from the ed she was oriented x 3 when woken, but very\nlethargic. per husband, patient had not slept in 72 hours on\nadmission and was likely hypersomnolent.   after sleeping,\npatient was much more interactive and a&o x 3.  a ct was\nperformed that showed no acute change.  mri was not performed\nbecause of patient's icd. workup for causes of altered mental\nstatus including b12, folate, tsh, and lfts were normal. rpr was\nrecently was negative.  when patient was transferred to the\nmedicine floor from the icu, she was sleepy but fully oriented.\npatient had one episode of confusion and delusions overnight for\nwhich she was treated with olanzapine. she was continued on\nolanzapine nightly (5mg) due to history of confusion,\nparticularly at night.  qtc was monitored during the\nhospitalization, and remained in the 440-460 range.  at\ndischarge, qtc was 392.\n.\n# acute kidney injury: on admission the patient's creatinine was\nincreased from baseline of 1.8-2.0 to 4.1.  patient had been\ntreated at outside rehab facility with diuresis for worsening\nkidney function due to the belief that it was being caused by an\nacute exacerbation of chf.  however, the patient was not\nresponsive to diuresis and in fact her kidney function continued\nto worsen.  on admission to the icu, the patient was thought to\nbe in prerenal failure (with questionable atn) most likely due\nto volume depletion and overdiuresis.  an ultrasound was\nperformed and showed no signs of obstruction.  the patient was\ntreated with iv fluid rehydration, and her kidney function\nimproved over the course of several days. at discharge patient's\ncreatinine had improved to 2.6.   her diuretics and ace\ninhibitor were held for the duration of her stay.  patient\nshould continue to have electrolytes carefully monitored when\nshe returns to her rehab facility.  at rehab, [**last name (un) **] and diuretic\ncan be restarted with her kidney function returns to baseline\n(creatinine of 2.0).  once her creatinine reaches 2.0 she can be\nstarted on losartan at home dose of 100mg daily.  when her\ncreatinine reaches 2.0 the patient can also be restarted on\nfurosemide, prior dose was 80mg, would favor starting more\nslowly that this when ready. patient should not be diuresed too\nrapidly given history of acute renal failure in setting of\nvolume depletion. we recommend keeping patient even to slightly\npositive until her creatinine improve and stabilizes.\n\n# chf: (see discussion above). diuretics were held during the\ntime of patient's admission.  patient was continued on a\nb-blocker metoprolol tartrate 50 mg po/ng [**hospital1 **] and isosorbide\ndinitrate 10 mg po/ng tid.  patient should continue these\nmedications as an outpatient.  patient can re-start diuretics\nand ace inhibitor, once her acute kidney injury has improved.\n(see above).\n\n#pneumonia:  when patient came in to the hospital she had a low\ngrade fever, cough and sob.  a chest x-ray from [**3-29**] in the icu\nshowed opacity in the lll, consistent with a pleural effusion.\na left thoracentesis was performed and 1000 ml of fluid removed,\nwith improvement in the patient's symptoms.  the fluid was sent\nfor culture, with no growth to date.  it was also sent for\ncytologic evaluation and was negative for any malignant cells.\nafter the drainage the patient was able to breathe much easier.\nthe patient continued to have a low grade fever off and on for\nthe next several days.  the patient was started on aztreonam for\nbroad coverage (is allergice to pennicillins so could not\nreceive a cephalosporin).  patient should continue receiving\naztreonam until [**2118-4-11**].  she should continue to receive\nvancomycin that is dosed by level because of rapidly changing\nrenal function.  vancomycin levels should be checked daily, with\na goal vancomycin trough of 15-20.  her vancomycin course stops\non [**2118-4-11**].\n\n#depression:  patient was evaluated by psychiatry during her\ninpatient stay on the medicine floor for suicidal ideation and\ndepression.  per husband, patient has had trouble with\ndepression and suicidal ideation in the past but has never had\nsuicidal attempt.  patient was titrated up on her fluoxetine by\n10mg q48h per psychiatry recommendations.  she is on 40mg daily\nof fluoxetine at date of discharge to rehab.  she should\ncontinue to be titrated up by 10mg every other day until she\nreaches her baseline home dose of 60mg daily. ** she should be\nincreased to 50mg daily on wednesday, [**4-6**] and titrated up to\nfinal home dose of 60mg on friday, [**4-8**].  patient was\nfollowed by psychiatry during her stay.  she was also seen by\nsocial work.  patient should follow up closely with her pcp\nafter discharge. ** it was recommended that patient have\nfrequent check-ins on her to help assuage anxiety throughout the\nday, perhaps hourly during the hours of [**7-15**] pm daily. as\ndiscussed with the patient, social work is working on setting up\noutpatient follow up with a therapist.\n\n# heel ulcer: patient was evaluated by both podiatry and wound\ncare during the duration of her stay. patient had previously\nbeen started on antibiotics at her rehab facility due to concern\nfor osteomyelitis infection.   an x-ray performed on [**3-29**] showed\nno cortical destruction or subcutaneous gas to suggest\nosteomyelitis.  podiatry felt that this ulcer was likely\nchronic, not infected and secondary to pvd and diabetes.  they\nrecommended that the patient did not need to continue on\nantibiotic therapy so treatment was stopped.  wound care\nrecommended protective boots and application of dry dressing\napplied daily.  patient should continue to have dressings\nchanged and checked by podiatry once she is discharged to her\nrehab facility.\n\n# cad: patient reported mild chest pain during one of her nights\non the inpatient medicine floor.  this was likely due to\nmusculoskeletal pain from coughing, but cardiac enzymes were\nsent to rule out mi given known cad and multiple risk factors.\nck-mb was found to be normal and trop-t only very mildly\nelevated.  her ekgs continued to be unchanged from prior.   she\nwas continued on [**month/year (2) **], clopidogrel, and atorvastatin.    patient\nshould continue on these medications after discharge.\n\n# borderline qtc:  patient was found to have mildly prolonged\nqtc on admission (450).  due to her history of torsades, her qtc\nwas monitored daily.  she received [**month/year (2) **] almost daily at\nnight.  no worsening qtc prolongation was noted during the\nadmission, but she should continued to undergo periodic ecgs to\nmonitor qtc while taking [**month/year (2) **]. upon discharge, qtc was 392\n(within normal limits).\n\n# dm: patient receieved a sliding scale of humolog while in\nhouse.  she also received her home dose of glargine [**hospital1 **]\n(16units, 8 units).  patient should continue on sliding scale\nper our recommendations and on glargine [**hospital1 **] as an outpatient in\nrehab.\n\n# hypothyroidism: patient was continued levothyroxine.  she\nshould be maintained on her home dose of levothyroxine as an\noutpatient.\n\n# anemia: patient appeared to be at her baseline throughout her\nstay here. iron studies prior to discharge were most consistent\nwith anemia of

c.diff colitis,\nrecent pneumonia, admitted to the icu with recurrent pna/sepsis\nand found to have rml/rll pna & and being empirically tx for c\ndiff colitis.\n.\n# pneumonia: the patient was admitted with high fever, hypoxia,\nand hypotension. his cxr showed evidence of a rml/rll pneumonia\nthought to be due to aspiration given dysphagia on swallow\nstudy. he was treated with a 14 day course of meropenem which\nwas completed today.  he does have pleural effusions but no\nthoracentesis was done given that it was difficult to position\nthe patient and there was not enough fluid to safely tap. he was\ngently diuresed during his admission. his ct scan showed\npulmonary nodules that need to be followed up as an outpatint.\ngiven his repeated pneumonias checked hiv ab and igg both\nunremarkable.  his b-glucan came back at >500 pg/ml.  given his\nclinical improvement and no known reason for immunocompromise he\nwas not treated for a fungal infection.  this lab should be\nredrawn in [**4-19**] weeks after discharge to ensure that it improves.\n a galactomannan was drawn while he was in the icu and should be\nfollowed up as an outpatint.  he was placed on a dysphagia diet\ngiven concern for repeat aspiration pna and failure of swallow\nstudy.  he required 3l of oxygen at the time of discharge (he\nhad 2l oxygen requirement prior to admisison).\n.\n# fever/ sepsis: pt has septic physiology in the ed and micu.\nshe grew gram + cocci in clusters in 1 bottle anaerobic from\n[**2186-7-2**] and was started on vancomycin iv which she received for\none day until it came back coag negative staph. his last fever\nwas [**2186-7-3**].  all other blood cx have been negative. his urine\ncx was negative (except for [**female first name (un) **]).  his fever/sepsis was\ntreated with a 14 day course of meropenem as detailed above\nunder the pna section.\n.\n# diarrhea: the patient had diarrhea while in the icu.  he was\nempirically treatment for c.diff although he was c diff negative\nx3 during this hospitalizatoin. he had 5 bm the day prior to\ndischarge some of which were loose stools.  given his completion\nof meropenem on [**2186-7-6**] the patient will be given an additional\n7 day course of flagyl with the last dose the eveing of [**2186-7-13**].\n his diarrhea may not be c diff in origin and could just be due\nto his meropenem.\n.\n# anisicoria: anisicoria was noticed on exam with r eye dilated\nmore than left.  this is an old finding for the patient as he\nhas a pcom aneurysm compressing cn iii.\n.\n# paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the patient is being continued\non his home dose of flecainide and digoxin.  his metoprolol was\ndecreased to [**hospital1 **] on [**7-1**] given occassional low hr and at times\nhis metoprolol still needs to be held for decreased bp.  he is\nbeing continued on aspirin. per a discussion the icu team had\nwith his pcp and cardiology he is not being anticoagulation\ngiven his history of falls.  on the medicine floor he did not\nhave a fib with rvr, however, he is at higher risk for rvr given\nthat he was started on ritalin. however, given his decreased\naffect and the positive effect of ritalin on his energy level we\nhave continued the ritalin.\n.\n#anemia: his hct has been stable at approximately 30.  the\nanemia is macrocytic and likely from liver disease. his recent\nb12/folate were within normal limits.  his ferrous sulfate\nsupplement should be continued.\n.\n# psych: the patient has bipolar disorder and has been stable on\ndepakote for several years with no recent changes. in the icu\nthere was concern for somnolence and his flat affect and his\nzyprexa was discontinued. given his decreased energy level he\nwas started on ritalin ([**2186-6-30**]) which he has responded to.  his\noutpatient psychiatrist dr. [**last name (stitle) 1968**] is aware of these changes.  i\nspoke with dr. [**last name (stitle) 1968**] about our concern for his depression and he\nwas started on citalopram 20mg daily ([**2186-7-3**]) which should be\nincreased to 30mg daily (on [**2186-7-10**]) if he does well on it.\ngiven his history of bipolar disorder he needs to be closely\nmonitored for symptoms of mania since his zyprexa was stopped\nand citalopram was started. he varied from a & o x2 to 3.  he\ndoes not always participate when asked date. his mental status\ncan wax and wanes sometimes with the patient not always\nanswering questions in an appropriate time frame especially in\nevening.  his affect is flat and his thinking is very slow.\n.\nsevere dry eyes and keratitis: also saw the patient and found\nsevere dry eyes and keratitis of the right eye.  continue\naritifical tears.\n.\n# ? liver disease: there is concern for liver disease given ap\n408, ast 89, inr 1.4, and mild thrombocytopenia.  he was hep c\nab neg. his hep b serologies were consistent with prior\ninfection (surface and core ab+). he hoes have a remote history\nof heavy alcohol use.  he needs outpatient liver follow up after\nhe leaves rehab.\n.\n# bradycardia/hypotension: he had a few short episodes of\nbradycardia and hypotension on arrival to ed which resolved.  he\nhas some low bps in the icu. he also had some sbp in the high\n80s/low 90s while on the medicine floor and he was\nassymptomatic.\n.\n# nutrition: he is on a dysphagia diet: po diet nectar thick\nliquids, soft solids, and pills whole with puree or nectar thick\nliquid.  he aspirated liquids when he takes large sips. at rehab\nhe can take small sips of regular liquids between meals if he is\nundersupervison.  he still has severe le edema which is likely\ninfluenced by poor nutrition.\n.\n#

presents to [**hospital unit name 153**] with\nfever, diagnosed with psuedomonas pneumonia\n.\n1. fever: ct of the chest and cxr showed rul opacity and sputum\nfrom admission grew out pseudomonas, pan-sensitive, except for\nciprofloxacin.  pt was given a dose of zosyn but developed hives\nover her back and thighs so zosyn was discontinued and she was\nstarted on aztreonam.  urine, blood ans stol cultures were all\nnegative.  given her chronic ngt a ct of the sinuses was done\nand showed no signs of chronic sinusitis.  on day of discharge,\npt had been afebrile x 48 hours.  a picc line was placed in\ninterventional radiology and pt should received 2 weeks of\naztreonam for her pseudomonas pneumonia.\n.\n2. chf: pt has an ef of 20% on recent echo.  due to some\nepisodes of hypotension, her bp meds were held and she required\nfluid boluses.  therefore, the pt remained positive during her\nshort hospital stay.  on day of discharge, pt was hypertensive\nand was tolerating her bp meds.  she was started on\nspironolactone and her hydralazine was stopped.  her dose of\nlasix may need to be decreased due to the addition of\nspironolactone.  she was continued on metoprolol, lasix, ace-i\nand digoxin.  her digoxin level was therapeutic.\n.\n3. tachy-brady syndrome s/p pcm: ep interrogated pacer on\nadmission and found that her [**hospital unit name 4448**] was working

support trial of [**10-12**],\noxygenating well.  her flovent and combivent were continued.\n.\n5. bp difference: per family, this is old. cannot assess\nsubclavian stenosis on ct due to pacer wires.\n.\n6. lung nodule: on chest ct, pt was found to have a 6mm nodular\ndensity within the right upper lobe that will need to be\nfollowed with another ct in 3 months.\n.\n7. anxiety: pt's seroquel was continued and she was started on\nprn seroquel.\n.\n8. fen: speech and swallow evaluated the patient and she passed\nthe bedside swallow exam.  however, to further evaluate
