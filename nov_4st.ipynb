      "Perform a thorough cardiovascular examination, noting any irregular heart rhythms, murmurs, or signs of heart failure, which may be associated with atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "Consider laboratory findings, such as electrolyte imbalances or markers of cardiac stress, as these may contribute to or result from atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "Use diagnostic tools, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), to confirm the presence of atrial fibrillation when suspected based on clinical findings.\n",

      "Integrate findings from subjective complaints, objective measurements, and clinical history to assess the likelihood of CAD or related cardiac conditions.\n",
      "Be vigilant for atypical presentations of CAD, especially in elderly patients or those with multiple comorbidities, as symptoms may not always be classic.\n",
      "Use a systematic approach to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as pulmonary or musculoskeletal issues, while keeping CAD in the differential diagnosis.\n",

      "The patient is a 67-inch individual with a history of bulging lumbar disks and chronic back pain, who is currently being treated for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity (LENI) and possible pulmonary embolism (PE) as suggested by the EKG findings of S1Q3T3 and elevated D-dimer. The patient is also experiencing pleuritic chest pain, a frontal headache, and mild nausea. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with normal oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, and is currently on a heparin sodium infusion to maintain a PTT of 60-80. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, and Troponin-T is also slightly elevated, which may indicate myocardial injury. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. The patient's CK level is slightly elevated, which may indicate muscle damage. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, which is consistent with the heparin therapy. The chest x-ray does not show any evidence of edema or pneumonia. The LENI ultrasound confirms DVT in the left popliteal vein. The patient's ECG shows possible right ventricular strain, which is consistent with PE. The patient's headache and mild nausea may be related to the PE or a side effect of the heparin therapy. Further evaluation with a CT angiogram is needed to confirm the PE diagnosis and assess the extent of the clot burden. The patient should also be evaluated for any underlying causes of the DVT, such as hypercoagulable states or malignancy. The patient's back and shoulder pain should be managed with analgesics, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of bleeding or hemodynamic instability related to the heparin therapy.\n",

      "The patient is a [age]-year-old with decreased breath sounds, poor air movement, and basilar crackles in the right lung field, consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has received Lasix for suspected fluid overload, which may be contributing to the pulmonary edema. The patient's WBC count has decreased slightly from 8.2 to 6.1 K/uL, and Hct has remained stable at 26.3%. The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine of 3.4 mg/dL. The patient is currently on sulfonamides, and the possibility of a drug reaction should be considered in the context of the patient's rash and echymoses. The patient's sinus bradycardia and irregular rhythm may be related to electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (3.4 mg/dL) or hypomagnesemia (2.8 mg/dL). The patient's normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen, and reducible epigastric hernia suggest no acute abdominal issues. The patient's neurological status is intact, with AAOx3 mentation. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -530 mL over the past 24 hours, which may indicate dehydration or ongoing fluid losses. The patient's troponin-T level is slightly elevated at 0.02 ng/mL, which may indicate myocardial injury, although the EKG shows sinus bradycardia without ST-segment or T-wave changes. Overall, the patient's condition is consistent with a picture of right lower lobe pneumonia, possible fluid overload, electrolyte abnormalities, and mild renal impairment. Close monitoring and further evaluation are required to determine the etiology of the patient's condition and guide appropriate management.\n",

      "The patient is an anxious elderly female who is currently confused, with no acute issues overnight. She is hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs, except for elevated blood pressure of 178/56 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated to 8.5 K/uL, and hemoglobin is mildly decreased to 12.3 g/dL. The patient is receiving Amoxicillin and has developed a rash, which may indicate an allergic reaction. The neuro exam shows that the patient is oriented to person but not to place or time, with spontaneous movement in all extremities. The patient's fluid balance is stable, with a slight positive balance of 38 mL over 24 hours. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL. The chest x-ray shows clear lungs, and the ECG shows sinus rhythm. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a low potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with delirium, and further workup is needed to determine the cause, including a comprehensive medication review, assessment for infection, and evaluation of other potential contributors such as metabolic derangements or structural brain abnormalities.\n",

      "The patient is a case of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a recent history of chest pain. The chest pain has been improving. The patient developed a rash after receiving PRBC and Bactrim, which may indicate a medication allergy. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped to 26.6 from 29.6 since admission, despite receiving a blood transfusion. This may suggest ongoing bleeding or another cause of anemia. The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T is slightly elevated at 0.46 ng/mL, indicating possible myocardial injury. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a PT of 17.2 seconds, PTT of 22.9 seconds, and INR of 1.5, which may contribute to the patient's bleeding risk. The patient's potassium is elevated at 5.1 mEq/L, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's magnesium and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's CK level is mildly elevated at 254 U/L, which may indicate muscle damage. The patient's calcium level is within normal limits. The patient's WBC count is within normal limits. The patient's clinical status, laboratory results, and medication reactions suggest a complex and evolving medical picture that requires close monitoring and further investigation.\n",

The patient is on invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and demonstrates adequate oxygen saturation, although the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is slightly reduced at 537. The patient has pinpoint pupils, which may suggest opioid effect or other neurologic process. The patient's hemodynamics show hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure, tachycardia, and reduced urine output, consistent with hypovolemia or sepsis. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and lactic acidosis, suggesting infection and end-organ dysfunction. The patient also has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating coagulopathy.

      "The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), who has been treated with cardioversion and various medications, including adenosine, metoprolol, amiodarone, phenylephrine, and levofloxacin. The patient remains tachycardic, with a current heart rate of 71 bpm, and hypotensive, with blood pressure readings as low as 78/45 mmHg. The patient's urine culture has been sent, and they have been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, which is likely the cause of the tachycardia. The patient is also exhibiting signs of possible renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by a high central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and a positive fluid balance. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an INR of 2.6, and they have evidence of chronic venous stasis changes in the right lower extremity. The patient's clinical status is concerning for sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and possible renal failure, and they require close monitoring and aggressive management.\n",

      "The patient is a 126 kg, 72-inch individual with a history of swallowing difficulty. The patient has been managed with antibiotics for infection and is currently hemodynamically stable, with blood pressure within normal range and SpO2 of 95% on room air. The patient is hypertensive at night, for which metoprolol has been administered. Electrolytes are within normal limits, with Na=143 and K=3.5. WBC count is slightly elevated at 9.3 K/uL, and platelets are stable at 96 K/uL. The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, but has improved from a high of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient has responded to verbal stimuli and is able to ambulate, but shows signs of agitation. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on metoprolol. The patient has also had a recent video swallow study that was normal, but failed a bedside swallow study. The patient's CK level is elevated at 7250 U/L, which may indicate muscle damage or inflammation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.\n",

Currently, the patient is sedated and receiving propofol infusion. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs, except for sinus bradycardia. The patient has evidence of fluid overload with negative fluid balance, bilateral pitting edema, and distended abdomen. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is also experiencing a rash and elevated eosinophils, possibly related to ceftriaxone. The patient has received vancomycin and aztreonam in the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory status is stable on standby mode with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with PT/PTT/INR of 26.2/56.3/2.5. The patient's clinical status suggests a diagnosis of sepsis, likely of hepatic origin, and fluid overload. The patient's renal function and liver function should be closely monitored. The patient's rash and eosinophilia may indicate a drug reaction, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's coagulation profile should be closely monitored in anticipation of a transplant.\n",

      "Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**] is a elderly female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), possible chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia. She was transferred from the ED intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea, and is currently extubated but experiencing significant challenges including hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, and worsening chronic heart failure (CHF). The patient has had recurrent hypotensive episodes, which may be related to medication adjustments, particularly clonidine and furosemide. The patient's respiratory status appears to have improved with a nasal cannula and SpO2 of 98%. However, the patient's renal function should be closely monitored, as there is a mild increase in creatinine from 0.8 to 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's lactic acid level is within normal limits, and electrolytes are relatively stable. The patient's current condition warrants close monitoring and potential adjustments in medication and supportive care to address the hemodynamic instability and hypoxia.\n",

      "The patient is a 68-inch tall man with a history of pericardial window surgery, which resulted in diffuse scarring of the pericardium. The patient has been experiencing mild to moderate discomfort, decreased urine output, and increased intravenous fluid intake. The latest CXR shows a left chest tube in place with no pneumothorax, but bilateral pleural effusions and a retrocardiac opacity. The patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 91 bpm and has decreased breath sounds at the bases, more so on the left. The WBC count has been fluctuating, with the most recent value being 151 K/uL. The patient is currently receiving cefazolin and has a right upper back surgical scar with a small dehisced area. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a BP of 99/55 mmHg and SpO2 of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.\n",

      "The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of agitation, who has been administered various psychotropic medications, including Haldol and Zyprexa, due to limited response to Haldol. The patient has numerous drug allergies, including anaphylaxis to Sulfa and Lyrica. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including Meropenem, Vancomycin, Azithromycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 107/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 insp/min. The patient is on a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 100% and an ABG of 7.33/53/91.\n",

The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with mildly weak dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. The patient has sores/ulcers over the shins bilaterally with erythematous skin around, and no hair on lower extremities below the knee. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, with a WBC of 16.8 K/uL, and anemia, with a Hct of 37.0%. The patient also has prolonged PT/PTT/INR, with a PT of 43.2, PTT of 48.0, and INR of 4.6. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a Cr of 1.5 mg/dL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's clinical picture is consistent with sepsis, likely due to a respiratory infection, given the decreased breath sounds and coarse breath sounds on exam. The patient's leukocytosis and anemia support this diagnosis. The patient's prolonged PT/PTT/INR suggests a coagulopathy, which may be due to sepsis or liver dysfunction. The patient's renal function is currently stable. The patient's numerous drug allergies, including anaphylaxis to Sulfa and Lyrica, and history of limited response to Haldol, present a challenge in managing the patient's psychotropic medications. The patient's sores/ulcers over the shins bilaterally with erythematous skin around, and no hair on lower extremities below the knee, suggest possible peripheral artery disease.\n",

      "The patient is a hospitalized individual with a history of shortness of breath, fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications, including diuretics and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's current vital signs show an afebrile temperature of 96°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 83 bpm, normal blood pressure of 94/62 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and decreased oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has experienced a weight gain of 0.5 kg since admission, and there is evidence of fluid overload with a negative fluid balance of -690 mL over 24 hours. The CXR reveals a smaller moderate right pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis, and large pulmonary metastases. The patient's WBC count has been gradually increasing, and the blood cultures are pending. The electrolytes, coagulation profile, and renal function are within normal limits. The troponin level is slightly elevated, and the patient has developed anemia and hyperglycemia during the hospital stay. The overall clinical picture suggests decompensated heart failure, possibly due to fluid overload or an arrhythmia, in the context of underlying malignancy and metastatic disease.\n",

The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. The liver function tests show mild elevations in ALT and AST, but are otherwise unremarkable. The stool culture results are pending. The patient continues to have a productive cough with green sputum and reports a recent prednisone taper.

The patient has not experienced any emesis overnight and has been hemodynamically stable. Lab results show a mildly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased creatinine, as well as elevated troponin-T levels. The patient has been on levofloxacin, vancomycin, and pantoprazole infusions, with a recent blood culture taken. The patient is currently on a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 98%. The patient's extremities show trace edema. The patient's mild back pain and elevated troponin-T levels, along with abnormal coagulation parameters, may suggest a possible musculoskeletal injury or a cardiac event. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause of these findings.\n",

The urinalysis shows moderate bacteria, 75 protein, trace leukocyte esterase, and pH 5.0. The urine culture is pending. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including cefipime, acyclovir, ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin. The TTE shows no valvular vegetations, but vegetations cannot be definitively excluded. The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a PT of 14.7 seconds, PTT of 31.9 seconds, and INR of 1.3. The patient's lactic acid is mildly elevated at 1.6 mmol/L.

      "The patient is a 61-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 108/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely related to sepsis given the presence of bibasilar rales, leukocytosis (WBC 30.2 K/uL), and elevated lactic acid (1.1 mmol/L). The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Metronidazole and Ceftriaxone, with the last doses given on 2151-9-5 10:00 AM and 04:00 PM, respectively. The patient's hemoglobin is 9.0 g/dL, and platelets are low at 80 K/uL. The patient's renal function is mildly impaired with a creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL, and fluid balance shows a negative balance of 530 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is also receiving medication for diarrhea, possibly related to Flagyl (Metronidazole) therapy. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 43 mmHg, which is elevated, suggesting fluid overload. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a low potassium level of 3.8 mg/dL. The patient's troponin level is slightly elevated at 0.05 ng/mL, but there is no evidence of chest pain or ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia. The patient's neurological status is intact (AAOx3). Overall, the patient's condition is critical due to sepsis and hypotension, and further management is required to optimize hemodynamics, antibiotic therapy, and source control.\n",

The patient has also received a 250cc bolus for diuresis with Lasix, without improvement. The patient's electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, should be closely monitored and corrected as needed. The patient's renal function should also be closely monitored, with a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 2.2 mmol/L, which may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 307 K/uL, with a high neutrophil percentage, which may suggest an infection. Blood cultures should be closely monitored for growth. The patient's respiratory status is stable at this time, with a SpO2 of 97% on a high flow nasal cannula.

The patient's CK has trended downward but remains elevated at 2546 K/uL. WBC count is slightly decreased, and Hct is within normal limits. The patient has received a blood transfusion, and coagulation studies show an elevated PT, PTT, and INR. Other labs show mild elevations in AST, ALT, and LDH. The patient has a mild metabolic acidosis based on ABG results. CSF analysis shows 4 WBC, 2 RBC, protein 82, and glucose 64. CT head shows no acute process, and an MRI is scheduled. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with rhabdomyolysis, likely secondary to the previous physical restraints and agitation. The patient may also have a component of hepatic injury and coagulopathy. Further workup with MRI and continued monitoring of CK and other labs is necessary to evaluate the extent of muscle damage and potential complications.

      "The patient is a 62-inch tall individual with a history of lactose intolerance who has been experiencing low urine output (UOP) and bloody bowel movements post-surgery. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped to 29 from 35, and they received two units of blood. The patient's current Hct is 29.7, and their hemoglobin (Hb) is 12.6 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.7 K/uL, and their platelet count (Plt) is 107 K/uL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, indicating a possible coagulation disorder. The patient's ALT and AST levels are slightly elevated, suggesting possible liver injury or dysfunction. The patient's lactic acid level is within normal limits, indicating adequate tissue perfusion. The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level is 0.5 mg/dL, indicating normal kidney function. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is elevated, suggesting possible tissue damage or injury. The patient's calcium level is low at 7.8 mg/dL, which may contribute to coagulation abnormalities. The patient's magnesium and phosphate levels are within normal limits. The patient's albumin level is low at 3.0 g/dL, indicating possible malnutrition or liver dysfunction. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 79 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95% on room air. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and mildly distended, with hyperactive bowel sounds. The patient's lower extremities are cool with weak but palpable distal pulses, suggesting possible peripheral vasoconstriction. The patient's urine output is low, with a total output of 230 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's current urine output is 191 mL. The patient's hematochezia is expected and likely related to the recent surgery. The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to the recent use of codeine and Bactrim DS. The patient's lactose intolerance may contribute to their gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's anemia and coagulation abnormalities may be related to their recent surgery, blood loss, or possible liver dysfunction. The patient's low calcium level may contribute to their coagulation abnormalities. The patient's low albumin level may contribute to their anemia, coagulation abnormalities, and possible malnutrition. The patient's mildly elevated liver enzymes and low calcium level may contribute to their coagulation abnormalities. The patient's low urine output may be related to their recent surgery, blood loss, or possible kidney dysfunction. The patient's peripheral vasoconstriction may be related to their low albumin level, low calcium level, or possible liver dysfunction. The patient's overall clinical status is fair, with stable hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. However, the patient's anemia, coagulation abnormalities, possible liver dysfunction, and low urine output require close monitoring and further investigation. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms may require further management, including possible endoscopic evaluation. The patient's lactose intolerance may require dietary modifications and lactase supplementation. The patient's nausea and vomiting may require antiemetic therapy. The patient's peripheral vasoconstriction may require fluid resuscitation and vasodilatory therapy. The patient's overall management should be multidisciplinary, involving surgeons, hematologists, nephrologists, gastroenterologists, and nutritionists.\n",

The ICH measures 2.9x6.1 cm and causes a 5mm midline shift. The patient has been exhibiting orthostatic hypotension and is currently hemodynamically stable, with a BP of 150/75 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 bpm. Neurological examination shows intact orientation and strength in all extremities. Laboratory results indicate normal electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation profile, except for a mildly elevated creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated at 9.4 K/uL, with a left shift. A repeat head CT and MRSA screen are pending. The patient's current condition is consistent with a worsening neurological status due to the ICH and SAH, with a risk of further neurological deterioration.\n",

The patient has a positive Hepatitis A Virus Antibody and negative Hepatitis B and C serologies. Blood cultures grew GNR x 2.

There is concern for a possible infection or bleeding episode given the elevated white blood cell count (151 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.8 g/dL), and increased creatinine (5.1 mg/dL). The patient also has evidence of bleeding from the right chest bandage with blood soaking through the dressing and an expanding area. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, which may contribute to the bleeding risk. The patient's neurological status is altered, and they are unable to tolerate the sling. The patient's TTP status needs to be considered in the management plan. Further evaluation is required to determine the source of bleeding and infection, and appropriate interventions should be implemented promptly.\n",

The patient is on antibiotics for an unknown infection, with a white blood cell count trending upwards. The patient is also experiencing diuresis with a large negative fluid balance, possibly due to the high doses of furosemide received. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's troponin levels are within normal limits, indicating no acute myocardial injury. The patient is alert and oriented, with stable vital signs, and no signs of infection on physical examination. The patient's INR is elevated at 3.0, likely due to the recent withholding of warfarin. The patient's low albumin level may indicate malnutrition or underlying inflammation.

The patient has started on a beta blocker and blood pressure medications have been restarted. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with normal sinus rhythm, normotensive, and afebrile. Lab results show a mild leukocytosis, normal troponin, and a mildly elevated creatinine. The chest radiograph demonstrates no acute cardiopulmonary process. The echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal biventricular systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, and a mildly dilated aortic root. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -614 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's clinical status and diagnostic studies suggest no acute cardiopulmonary process, however, close monitoring for potential complications related to the EP study and medication management is required.\n",

The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with low Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 levels. CT ab/pelvis is pending. The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of sepsis secondary to an underlying infectious process, possibly enterocolitis, contributing to the diarrhea. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia warrant close monitoring and potential intervention for septic shock. The electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected to prevent further complications.

Post-operative CT scan shows cerebellar edema, concerning for upward transtentorial herniation and developing hydrocephalus. The patient is being treated with dexamethasone, mannitol, and various other medications to manage intracranial pressure, pain, and other symptoms. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with no acute distress. However, there is a decreasing trend in hematocrit, which may indicate post-operative bleeding. The patient's renal function and electrolytes are within normal limits. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, intracranial pressure, and hematocrit is required.\n",

The EKG showed a sinus rhythm, and the latest troponin-T level is 8.35 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy for prophylaxis. The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, as the creatinine level has increased to 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's clinical status and diagnostic findings are concerning for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

      "The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of ERCP and placement of a 10Fr x 7cm plastic stent in the common bile duct. The patient has been receiving antibiotics including Gentamicin, Ampicillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and is currently on Pantoprazole and Morphine Sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 142/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, however, the hematocrit is slightly decreased to 35.4 and platelets are slightly elevated to 205 K/uL. The patient's renal function is normal with a creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests show a mildly elevated ALT and AST, with a normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with a PT of 13.5, PTT of 25.5 and INR of 1.1. The patient is producing a large amount of urine, with a total output of 2450 mL in 24 hours. The patient's abdomen is soft, tender in the RUQ with 2 JP drains in place. The patient is alert and oriented, moving all extremities, and has no focal neurological deficits. The patient's skin is clear, with no jaundice, cyanosis or ecchymoses.\n",

      "The patient is an elderly female with a history of end-stage renal disease, currently complaining of neck and chest pain. The EKG shows ST depressions laterally and LVH, which may indicate ischemia. The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and diastolic dysfunction, as evidenced by an elevated PCWP on the echocardiogram. The TEE reveals mild aortic valve stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. The patient's labs show anemia, elevated creatinine, and prolonged PT/PTT/INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's lethargy and hypothermia may be indicative of altered mental status, which warrants further investigation. The patient's overall clinical status should be closely monitored, and further workup, such as a cardiac consultation and possible stress testing, should be considered to evaluate for ischemia.\n",

The patient is receiving Heparin sodium and Nitroglycerin infusions, as well as Midazolam for sedation. Fluid balance shows negative balance over 24 hours, with urine output slightly exceeding fluid intake. Laboratory results indicate a mild leukocytosis, decreased hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with prolonged PT, PTT, and normal INR. Electrolytes are within normal limits, except for decreased calcium and magnesium levels. The patient's metabolic panel shows mild acidemia. The urinalysis is unremarkable. The patient has an erythematous rash on the flanks, which is slightly pruritic and improving. The wound site is clean, dry, and intact. The patient's extremities have palpable pulses, and the femoral artery is without bruit.

The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with a heart rate ranging from 96 to 135 bpm, and blood pressure in the 140s/70s mmHg. The patient had a brief period of atrial flutter with no ventricular response. The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium and warfarin. The patient's renal function is within normal range, with a creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated at 7.7 K/uL, which may indicate an inflammatory response or infection. The patient's total fluid balance is negative, indicating a possible state of hypovolemia. The patient's distended abdomen and lower extremity edema may suggest fluid overload or heart failure. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is within therapeutic range for warfarin therapy. The patient's coagulation profile shows a mildly prolonged PT and PTT, which is expected with heparin therapy. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal limits, indicating no evidence of myocardial injury. The patient's electrocardiogram shows atrial flutter with a variable block.

Renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient has possible renal artery stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, as suggested by the resistive indices and tarud/parvus waveforms on renal ultrasound. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's hematocrit is slightly elevated at 42.1%, which may be due to dehydration from the large urine output of 2775 mL in 24 hours. The patient's urinalysis and imaging studies do not show any acute processes. The patient's oxygenation is adequate, with an SpO2 of 99% on room air. The patient's renal function, electrolytes, and oxygenation should be closely monitored. The patient's hypertension should be aggressively managed with a multidisciplinary approach, including nephrology and cardiology consultation.\n",

      "The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis secondary to choledochocholelithiasis, which was recently managed with an ERCP procedure that revealed pus and a stone. The patient also underwent sphincterotomy and is currently receiving antibiotics (Unasyn) for 7 days. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are tolerating a diet. However, the patient is experiencing hives, which requires further evaluation and management. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, indicating liver injury or inflammation, likely related to the cholangitis. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response or infection. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) count are decreasing, which may indicate a consumptive coagulopathy or bleeding. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. The patient's calcium (Ca++) level is low, which may contribute to the patient's coagulopathy. The patient's magnesium (Mg++) and phosphorus (PO4) levels are within normal limits. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is slightly elevated, which may indicate tissue damage or inflammation. Overall, the patient requires close monitoring for potential complications related to cholangitis, ERCP, and coagulopathy.\n",

      "The patient has been experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath (SOB). The troponin-T level peaked at 0.25, indicating a possible myocardial injury. There have been episodes of bradycardia, reaching the 40s, and intermittent hypoxia, which could be related to an underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, as evidenced by a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient is also anemic, with a hematocrit of 36.2%, and has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 23.0 K/uL. The patient is receiving antibiotics, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -2,861 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's acid-base status and electrolytes should be closely monitored, as the PT, PTT, and INR are slightly abnormal. The patient's hypoxia and troponin elevation warrant further investigation for possible cardiac ischemia.\n",

      "The patient is demonstrating signs of severe left ventricular dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%, as evidenced by the objective data from the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This is accompanied by a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity and abnormal septal motion. There is also mild mitral regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated and decreasing over time, which may suggest an infection process. The patient's renal function, as indicated by creatinine (Cr) levels, is mildly elevated but stable. The patient's electrolytes, including calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4), are within normal limits. The Troponin-T level is slightly elevated, indicating some level of myocardial injury. The clinical picture is consistent with a diagnosis of heart failure, likely due to a cardiomyopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of the cardiomyopathy and to guide management.\n",

      "The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and significant vascular disease, who presented for anesthesia-assisted urological transurethral resection of presumed bladder cancer. The patient is currently stable with normal vitals, except for sinus bradycardia. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slightly negative fluid balance. The physical examination is unremarkable, with the exception of mild expiratory wheezes on lung auscultation. Laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, normal electrolytes, and normal coagulation profile. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with the exception of a mildly decreased potassium level of 3.9 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is within normal limits at 122 mg/dL. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's urine output is being closely monitored in the context of the bladder cancer surgery and the negative fluid balance. The patient's post-procedure monitoring is ongoing for any potential complications related to the surgery or anesthesia. The patient's current medication regimen is being maintained, with the addition of as-needed pain management and antiemetic medications.\n",

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with an SpO2 of 91% on a face tent and a respiratory rate of 22. The patient has been coughing and undergoing aggressive chest physiotherapy. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 9.0 K/uL, and the hematocrit is low at 29.6%, which may indicate anemia. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 140/57 mmHg. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's ceftriaxone antibiotic was last administered at 12:32 AM, and the patient is also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium. The patient's allergies include ampicillin rash and codeine-induced nausea/vomiting. The patient's medical history and review of systems are largely unchanged from admission. The patient's current condition may be due to a combination of the lung collapse, respiratory compromise, and potential infection, given the slightly elevated WBC count. Further evaluation and management are required to address the patient's respiratory status and lung collapse.\n",

He has elevated CK levels (260,000) indicative of rhabdomyolysis, likely due to prolonged immobilization or drug-related effects. The patient has been treated with dialysis for hyperkalemia and hypothermia protocol. He is currently intubated and on a ventilator, with adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stability. The patient has a Staphylococcus aureus infection based on sputum culture. Initial renal function was impaired (Cr 4.2 mg/dL), but has shown improvement (Cr 2.8 mg/dL). The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT 630 IU/L, AST 920 IU/L) and coagulopathy (PT 13.6, PTT 29.4, INR 1.2), consistent with liver injury possibly related to drug use or hypoxic hepatitis. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated (12.3 K/uL), and Troponin-T is mildly elevated (0.83 ng/mL), suggesting potential myocardial injury. Close monitoring of renal function, cardiac enzymes, and coagulation parameters is required. The patient's neurological status is appropriate for his sedation level, following commands and responding to stimuli.\n",

The patient's left ventricular function has improved compared to the previous study, but there is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension present. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, nitroglycerin, heparin sodium, and lorazepam. Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 97%. WBC count is 10.1 10^3/uL, Hct is 30.8%, Plt is 146 10^3/uL, and Cr is 0.8 mg/dL. The ECG shows sinus rhythm. Chest X-ray reveals patchy opacities in both lungs, more pronounced in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. The overall clinical picture suggests a patient with improved left ventricular function but severe pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure, likely due to underlying lung pathology such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Close monitoring and optimization of respiratory support are required.\n",

The patient's Hct has remained stable, and there was a small amount of perirectal blood loss, which was addressed with an 18 gauge access. The patient is on pantoprazole for UGI management. The patient's hemoglobin is 8.8 g/dL, hematocrit is 25.3%, and platelets are 58 K/uL, indicating severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient also shows evidence of coagulopathy with an INR of 1.2. The patient's WBC count is elevated at 25.3 K/uL, which may indicate an infection or inflammation. The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine of 2.66 mg/dL. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 98 bpm and has crackles at the bases bilaterally, suggestive of heart failure and pulmonary fibrosis. The patient also shows signs of fluid overload with weeping edema and 3+ lower extremity edema. The patient's pleural effusion has increased since admission. The patient's hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia may contribute to her coagulopathy and anemia. The patient's current condition may be a result of progression of her underlying diseases, medication side effects, or an acute event such as sepsis or another UGI bleed. Close monitoring, further investigations and management of her anemia, coagulopathy, and fluid overload are required.\n",

She has been transitioned from insulin drip to Lantus with a sliding scale due to high SBPs, and has been started on vancomycin for possible line-related infection. She is experiencing sinus tachycardia with a rate of 122 bpm and borderline hypertension. The patient has mild diffuse tenderness in the abdomen, and there are violaceous lesions on her finger tips, which may indicate finger sticks. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. The patient's creatinine is stable at 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT, PTT, and normal INR. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's finger stick blood glucose has significantly improved from 279 mg/dL to 136 mg/dL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits. The patient's chest x-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary findings. The patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia. The patient's clinical picture is suggestive of sepsis, likely secondary to line infection, with possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and transaminitis. The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be due to sepsis or pain. The patient's mild abdominal tenderness may be due to sepsis or other underlying etiology. The patient's violaceous lesions on her finger tips may be due to finger sticks or other underlying etiology. The patient's leukocytosis and decreased hematocrit may be due to sepsis or other underlying etiology. The patient's prolonged PT, PTT, and normal INR may be due to DIC or other underlying etiology. The patient's normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels may indicate normal electrolyte balance. The patient's improved finger stick blood glucose may indicate improved glycemic control. The patient's normal urine output may indicate normal renal function. The patient's normal chest x-ray and ECG may indicate normal cardiopulmonary status. The patient's clinical picture is concerning for sepsis, DIC, and transaminitis, and further workup and management is required.\n",

The patient's lactic acid level is normal at 0.5 mmol/L. The patient's CK and CKMB levels are within normal limits, suggesting no significant muscle damage. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile shows a mildly prolonged PT and PTT, but INR is within normal limits. The patient's lactate level is normal, indicating adequate tissue perfusion. The patient's albumin level is low at 3.5 g/dL, suggesting malnutrition or inflammation.
