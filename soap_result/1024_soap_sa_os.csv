TEE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.",Neck pain; Chest pain; ST depressions; LVH; ESRD; HD; HTN; HL; Acute CHF exacerbation; NSTEMI; DES in LAD; DES in LMCA

Fluid analysis / Other labs: None.
Imaging: Echo [**3-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with distal inferoseptum, inferior wall
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-3-15**], the
region of hypokinesis in the distal inferoseptum has decreased.

-EGD showed friability at site of anastamosis which was injected and
