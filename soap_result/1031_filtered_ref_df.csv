Fluid analysis / Other labs: Immunoglobulin G 506* mg/dL (normal:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10254**])
Imaging: neck ultrasound: 1. Left internal jugular vein and left
subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
posterior
aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
be related to intubated state).

infectious or inflammatory in nature. In the presence of bilateral
effusions
and ascites, third-spacing could also call diffuse bowel wall edema.

seen
throughout the entire colon suggesting diarrhea.

The endotracheal tube has been removed in the interval. The
nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. The ventilation of the lung
parenchyma is slightly improved, with slightly increased lung volumes.
However, the pre-existing bilateral focal parenchymal opacities show
clear
visibility despite a small reduction in extent. There is no evidence of
pleural effusion. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

Imaging: [**1-27**] CT Head
FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia involving the right
cerebellar hemisphere consistent with old infarct.  There are
periventricular white matter hypodensities which could be the result of
chronic small vessel
ischemic change.  There is no mass effect or shift of the midline
structures.
No abnormal enhancing lesion is identified.  There is mild prominence
of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci, which is likely the
result of
age-related brain atrophy.
The visualized bony structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.  No
intracranial
hemorrhage.  No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.  Area of
encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.  Changes
suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.

Imaging: IMPRESSION:
1.  Pneumoperitoneum and  fluid accumulation adjacent to the second
part of
the duodenum, which extends into the right anterior pararenal spaces,
are
suggestive of perforation of ulcer of second part of duodenum.
2.  Interval development of complete collapse of L4 lumbar vertebra and
interval decrease in the soft tissue mass of the pedicle of L4.  As no
IV
contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac compression cannot be
performed.
3.  Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Interval development of high density mass in right adrenal gland in
1 month
is suggestive of either benign etiologies such as hematoma or
metastatic
disease ( underlyng small cell lung cancer) .
IMPRESSION:  No large amount of free intraperitoneal air identified.
If
clinical suspicion is high, decubitus film or standing upright film is
recommended.
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2161-3-15**], there is little
change in
the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
catheter,
or the pacemaker leads.  The hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
seen,
consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  Mild
fullness
of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.
The somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
base
laterally is again seen.

Imaging: CXR: New retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity likely
represents left lower lobe aspiration, however, atelectasis or
pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
CTA Chest: prelim: 1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity
within bilateral lung parenchyma most compatible with infectious
etiology.
2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
right
and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
subsegmental
branches. 3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor
muscles may represent hematoma, fluid collections-abscess, or muscular
infarction. This is also at the location of previous interventions in
the left groin for IVC filter placement. Clinical correlation is
recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess formation, an MRI
can be obtained for further evaluation. 4. Bilateral renal cysts, liver
cysts and enlarged prostate.

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the ET tube, NG tube, left PICC
line and right internal jugular line are unchanged. Moderate bilateral
pleural
effusions are unchanged. Increased density in the right perihilar and
right
apical regions are consistent with worsening consolidation, probably
pneumonia. Also increased pulmonary venous congestion with perihilar
haziness and peribronchial cuffing in the setting of a top normal heart
and enlargement of the azygos vein are consistent with worsening
pulmonary edema.

mild dilation of the pancreas duct to 5mm was seen at the head of the

TEE - The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30
cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
