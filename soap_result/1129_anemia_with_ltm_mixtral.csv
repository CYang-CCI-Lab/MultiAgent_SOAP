TE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20-25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. The degree of
mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. The degree of aortic
stenosis has incrased slightly. LV systolic function remains severely
depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
on the prior study.
CXR: Improved pulmonary edema which is now mild with stable left
perihilar opacity, worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely
consolidation, probably pneumonia,less likely asymmetrical pulmonary
edema.","sepsis ; altered/depressed m thought to be [ * * 1-25 * * ] to ativan yesterday , ; # acute on chronic renal failure ; supertherapeutic inr ; afib , now rate control - likely worsen by underlie sepsis ; s/p biv placement [ * * 8-31 * * ] . ; demand ischemia","Sepsis; Altered/Depressed Mental Status thought to be [**1-25**] to ativan yesterday,; # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure; supertherapeutic International Normalized Ratio; Atrial fibrillation, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying sepsis; status post Biventricular placement [**8-31**].; demand ischemia",Depressed Mood;Sepsis;Demand ischemia;sepsis;Acute on Chronic Right Heart Failure,acute on chronic renal failure;Demand ischemia;afib;depressed;sepsis,Altered Mental Status;Sepsis;Demand ischemia;alternation;Biventricular failure;Atrial fibrillation;sepsis;Acute on Chronic Right Heart Failure,sepsis; altered depressed mental status thought to be to ativan yesterday ; acute on chronic renal failure; supertherapeutic international normalized ratio; atrial fibrillation now rate controlled likely worsened by underlying sepsis; status post biventricular placement ; demand ischemia,"['sepsis', 'altered depressed mental status thought to be to ativan yesterday', 'acute on chronic renal failure', 'supertherapeutic international normalized ratio', 'atrial fibrillation now rate controlled likely worsened by underlying sepsis', 'status post biventricular placement', 'demand ischemia']",True,No

   MR. Etiology of MR could be ischemic. Has echo showing new antero
   apical wall motion abnormality which would suggest plaque in LAD. Has
   poor R wave progression which would be consistent with anterior
   ischemia but her ST depressions are in V5-V6 more consistent with
   ischemia involving Lcx -this may suggest diffuse disease. Also has ?
   PNA, endocarditis a possibility although no evidence of this on echo.
   Ischemia does not seem to be just demand related.","NSTEMI; Newly worsened MR; Hypotension: acutely hypotensive, concern was for ischemia/infarct

3. Dense material in the consolidated/collapsed RLL, ? aspiration vs
PNA.
CXR:
There is continued evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion and a small right effusion. There is
increased
streaky density at the right base consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis.
The heart appears enlarged as before. The aorta is tortuous and
calcified.
Compared with the previous study there is little interval change.
US Abdomen:
Direct son[**Name (NI) 330**] examinations were performed on the four abdominal
quadrants. There is a small pocket of ascites in the right lower
quadrant,
measuring approximately 3.8 x 2.6 cm (AP x TRV). A trace amount of
fluid is
noted in the deep pelvis. Limited views of the kidneys demonstrate no
evidence of hydronephrosis.

Moderately dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

76 yo M w/ PMHx of DVT/ PE, a fib, hyperlipidemia, CRI, severe AS, BPH
and MGUS presented with nausea, abdominal pain and emesis. Pt presented
on [**11-20**] with pain by his ventral hernia (which is located on his
abdomen to the left of the midline). EMS was called due to severe pain
and pt brought to [**Hospital1 54**] where he was deemed to have a SBO. He was
treated conservatively with fluids, NG tube, and NPO and appears to
have done well. It is believed that his SBO will likely recurr
secondary to an unrepaired ventral hernia and surgery wanted to fix
ther hernia to prevent this from occurring. Cardiology was called to
give pre-op clearance prior to hernia repair.  The pt said that he did
not want either the surgery for his ventral hernia or for his AS (even
a percutaneous procedure).  Treated on the floor, with conservative
mgmt, and all procedures deferred.  Afternoon of [**11-23**], with new onset
tachypnea and tachycardia, accompanied by mild hypotension.

Fluid analysis / Other labs: Immunoglobulin G 506* mg/dL (normal:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10254**])
Imaging: neck ultrasound: 1. Left internal jugular vein and left
subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
posterior
aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
be related to intubated state).

[**9-27**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Areas of mild thickening of the small bowel wall, most prominent in
the
right lower quadrant. This finding is suggestive of enteritis, likely
infectious or inflammatory in nature. In the presence of bilateral
effusions
and ascites, third-spacing could also call diffuse bowel wall edema.
Unlikely
due to ischemia.
2. Mild bowel wall thickening/edema seen in the ascending colon. Fluid
seen
throughout the entire colon suggesting diarrhea.
3. Moderate amount of predominantly perihepatic ascites extending down
to the
pelvis.
4. Moderately sized bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis,
unchanged since previous MRI abdomen study of [**2136-9-6**].
[**9-27**] RUQ U/S:
CONCLUSION: Ascites. Minimal sludge in the gallbladder. No focal liver
lesions or abscesses identified. No ultrasound evidence for acute
cholecystitis.
[**9-25**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No CT findings to suggest a new site of infection in the lungs.
2. Reduction in size of pleural effusions with associated improvement
in
adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Unchanged small right apical lung nodule.
4. Persistent small pericardial effusion and ascites.","severe sepsis - band up to 32 this morning with sign of develop dic , unclear [ * * name2 ( ni ) 10137 * * ] although most likely seem to be gi ; # develop dic ; aml","Severe sepsis - Bands up to 32 this morning with signs of developing

maging: Barium esophagram
FINDINGS: A previously placed nasogastric tube was slightly retracted
about
to the level where the side hole of the tube was located in the mid
esophagus.
Subsequently, barium was injected and the esophagus was filled with
barium
about from the carina to the GE junction. There was no evidence of
leak.
Subsequently, the nasogastric tube was further retracted with the side
hole
about at the level of the thoracic inlet. Barium was again injected and
the
more proximal portion of the esophagus was demonstrated. There was no
evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
junction
into the stomach.
At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
the GE
junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
This
location was confirmed by contrast injection.
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated
part
of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).

Summary for morning rounds:
39 year old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic
syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infections transferred for
assessment of altered mental status.  Recent Klebsiella UTI treated
with ertapenem and cipro at [**Location (un) 78**]. Returns to [**Location (un) 78**]  with fatigue,
low temps, and mild cough and congestion.  Initial vitals were notable
for a temperature of 92.7.  Initial urinalysis was positive and he was
started on ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection.  Subsequent
culture has been negative.  He had a head CT which showed possible
blood in the third ventricle.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
On arrival to our emergency room his initial vs were: T 96.2 P: 61 BP:
120/71 R: 14 O2 sat 96%RA. Seen by neurosurgery who recommended only
platelets at this time.
On admission the patient alert and oriented x 3 but more lethargic than
usual.  Decreased strength in UE.  Witnessed tonic-clonic seizure X2
while on floor with subsequent hypoxia.  PNA on CXR on admission, but
also possible aspiration during event. T max on the floor has been
100.8  and he was continued on meropenem out of concern for UTI.  He
had an EEG which showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
Patient altered on arrival to MICU.  Tracks, orients to voice. No
purposeful answers to questions.","Last dose of Antibiotics:

Had three subsequent episodes of hypotension and was fluid responsive.
However, urine osmoles still high and urine sodium low.  Talked to
renal and outcome of boluses and urine lytes was that patient was in
fact likely hypovolemic, as his pressures finally improved and urine
osmolality fell, with a concurrent rise in serum sodium, after adequate
volume ressucitation.

The endotracheal tube has been removed in the interval. The
nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. The ventilation of the lung
parenchyma is slightly improved, with slightly increased lung volumes.
However, the pre-existing bilateral focal parenchymal opacities show

Fluid analysis / Other labs: [**1-26**] U/A negative
Imaging: [**1-27**] CT Head
FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia involving the right
cerebellar hemisphere consistent with old infarct.  There are
periventricular white matter hypodensities which could be the result of
chronic small vessel
ischemic change.  There is no mass effect or shift of the midline
structures.
No abnormal enhancing lesion is identified.  There is mild prominence
of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci, which is likely the
result of
age-related brain atrophy.
The visualized bony structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.  No
intracranial
hemorrhage.  No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.  Area of
encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.  Changes
suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.

   lesions, likely due to embolic events.","CVA, including a large cerebellar infarction.; AFib; apnea","HPI:
84 year old woman w a history of atrial fibrillation without
anticoagulation and pacemaker placement for bradycardia was transferred
to the T-SICU for multiple CNS defecits. The patient was admitted to
cardiology on [**2197-7-8**] for a CHF exacerbation with DOE x2 wk. She had
hoarseness starting on [**7-6**]. On [**7-8**], the patient triggered for AMS and
tachycardia to 140 and was treated for AFib. On [**7-9**] at 0100, the
patient was found to be dysarthric and weak. She recieved a CT head,
which showed several subacute and chronic sites of infarction. At
7:30AM, the patient was noted to have difficulty speaking, difficulty
swallowing, and right-sided weakness. A CTA showed a right cerebellar
infarct with concern for evolution from 1 am to 11 am today, also left
ICA occlusion. The patient is currently oriented x1 with R-sided facial
droop, R arma and leg weakness (3/5 strength), and profoundly
dysarthric.
Injuries:
- evolving left cerebellar infarct
- occlusion of the left common carotid artery within a centimeter of
its origin.
- intraluminal thrombus of the distal right vertebral artery
- left subclavian artery is occluded at its origin, with extensive
surrounding atherosclerotic calcification.
- It is likely that the left vertebral artery participates in a so

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the radiographic
signs
suggesting pulmonary edema have decreased in severity. The increase of
reticular markings and of retrocardiac opacities with air bronchograms
is
still clearly visible, however, substantially less severe than on the
previous
radiograph. On today's image, presence of a small left-sided pleural
effusion
cannot be excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No
evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

represent
an area of consolidation. A lateral view would be helpful if the

The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (LVEF~55%). Right ventricular free
wall motion is probably well visualized although not well visualized.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly to moderately thickened with probably no significant aortic
stenosis (aortic velocity measurements were technically limited). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly

to an OSH with HA, weakness on her left, and possible seizure activity,
and while at OSH found to have large intraparenchymal bleed.  She was
intubated at OSH, given dilantin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSGY
eval.  She reportedly had reactive pupils prior to transfer, but on
arrival, she had fixed/dilated pupils.
n the ED, initial VS: 97.6, 78, 127/55, 100% AC/480/16/5/100%.  She
had a CT head which showed a 3 cm IPH above thalamus with extension
into third ventricle, and evidence of likely impending herniation.  She
was evaluted by NSGY, and had an emergent external ventricular drain
placed for elevated ICP (initially 45 in ED, on repeat prior to
transfer 32).  Her labs revealed pancytopenia, decreased fibrinogen,
and concern for DIC.  Heme/onc was called in the ED, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

given 2 units pRBC, 2 units of plts prior to transfer to the MICU for
further management.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from neurosurgery held family meeting and
explained grave prognosis to the family.

Currently, she is  intubated, sedated.  She is not responsive to voice.
ICP increased now (8AM) from 27 to 50. STAT head CT showed markedly
increased hemorrhage and likely incipient herniation. NSY (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

Imaging: IMPRESSION:
1.  Pneumoperitoneum and  fluid accumulation adjacent to the second
part of
the duodenum, which extends into the right anterior pararenal spaces,
are
suggestive of perforation of ulcer of second part of duodenum.
2.  Interval development of complete collapse of L4 lumbar vertebra and
interval decrease in the soft tissue mass of the pedicle of L4.  As no
IV
contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac compression cannot be
performed.
3.  Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Interval development of high density mass in right adrenal gland in
1 month
is suggestive of either benign etiologies such as hematoma or
metastatic
disease ( underlyng small cell lung cancer) .
IMPRESSION:  No large amount of free intraperitoneal air identified.
If
clinical suspicion is high, decubitus film or standing upright film is
recommended.
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2161-3-15**], there is little
change in
the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
catheter,
or the pacemaker leads.  The hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
seen,
consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  Mild
fullness
of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.
The somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
base
laterally is again seen.

represents left lower lobe aspiration, however, atelectasis or
pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
CTA Chest: prelim: 1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity
within bilateral lung parenchyma most compatible with infectious
etiology.
2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
right
and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
subsegmental
branches. 3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor
muscles may represent hematoma, fluid collections-abscess, or muscular
infarction. This is also at the location of previous interventions in
the left groin for IVC filter placement. Clinical correlation is
recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess formation, an MRI
can be obtained for further evaluation. 4. Bilateral renal cysts, liver
cysts and enlarged prostate.

This organism may develop resistance to third generation
cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that
are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections,
repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted
if third generation cephalosporins were used.

levels. No evidence of free air, no evidence of pathological
calcifications.
EGD [**1-7**];
Clotted blood was seen in the colon. The distal polypectomy site could
not be located due to clot and stool, however there appeared to be less
blood more proximal to the decending colon suggesting that this is the
bleeding source. No active bleeding was seen.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

nausea just prior to discharge from SS to Rehab (and daughter feels
they did not do anything about it at [**Hospital6 707**]); possible
source of an infection or other process that caused PEA arrest?
- sinus tachycardia - started metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] - concerned
about beta blocker withdrawal. Gave 500cc to see if it would help sinus
tachycardia (low CVP as well) and following patient developed
respiratory distress (see below).
- patient became tachycardic 150s, hypertensive SBP 200, respiratory

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the ET tube, NG tube, left PICC
line and right internal jugular line are unchanged. Moderate bilateral
pleural
effusions are unchanged. Increased density in the right perihilar and
right
apical regions are consistent with worsening consolidation, probably
pneumonia. Also increased pulmonary venous congestion with perihilar
haziness and peribronchial cuffing in the setting of a top normal heart
and enlargement of the azygos vein are consistent with worsening
pulmonary edema.

Findings suggestive of dural-based metastatic disease bifrontally,
right greater than left, which may invade the anterior aspect of the
sagittal sinus. There is an extra-axial lesion in the left frontal lobe
which may represent metastatic disease or meningioma. No evidence of
hemorrhage.

septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, infero-lateral and apical
akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Off of yesterday the patient was able to follow some basic commands
like squeezing hands, moving both feet.  He would not open and close
his eyes but did appear to be tracking.   This morning he is writhing
in bed, moving all extremities spontaneously.  On lung exam he has
coarse central breathing sounds.  Heart slightly tachy but regular w/
IV/VI systolic murmur.  Abdomen soft, NTND.  RUE swelling is stable, LE
with wrinkled skin but improved edema.

Imaging: [**2-6**] CXR - portable AP CHEST: A faint outline of a peripheral
line is visualized in the
region of the right lower neck. The tip of the line likely projects
over the
right internal jugular vein although this is difficult to assess
radiographically. Compared to the examination from three days prior
there has
been marked improvement in pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette
remains
mildly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent. There
is no
consolidation. Incidental note is made of the outline of a stent
projecting
over the left upper arm.

clear, with no signs of consolidation, pleural effusions, or
pneumothorax.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates normal heart size with
mild
atherosclerotic calcification seen within the aortic knob.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echo
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a patent stent and no angiographically
apparent disease. The Cx had no angiographically apparent disease. The
RCA had a distal 95% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow into the more distal
branches.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided filling
pressure of 30 mmHg (LVEDP). The central aortic pressure was 97/58
mmHg.
There was no transaortic gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 34%. There was
hypokinesis of the posterobasal, inferior, apical and anterolateral

Imaging: CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection.
2. Unchanged appearance of innumerable bilateral spiculated pulmonary
nodules, most consistent with metastatic disease.
3. Unchanged appearance of low-attenuation foci within the liver, which
may
represent metastatic disease.
4. Unchanged appearance of multiple osseous metastatic lesions.
.
CXR:
Multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities are similar in appearance to
previous studies, although there is slightly increased opacity seen at
the
left base. Most likely, these represent the patient's known bilateral
metastatic disease, though it is difficult to exclude an underlying
pneumonia
at the left base. There is no significant pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. Left basilar atelectasis is slightly improved.

- Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
- follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
- recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
seizure   activity
- minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
- EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.

- CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
- CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
causing mild spinal canal stenosis.

silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size or slightly
enlarged. No
evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
There is mild asymmetry at the bases, with suggestion of some patchy
opacification on the right. This could merely reflect atelectasis,

the proper clinical situation, the possibility of aspiration pneumonia
should
be considered.","respiratory failure/copd : ; hypotension ; atrial flutter previously , now s/p ablation and in sinus rhythm . ; diabetes type ii :","Respiratory failure/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:; Hypotension; atrial flutter previously, now status post ablation and in sinus rhythm.; Diabetes Type II:","atrial flutter;Hypotension NEC;Diabetes Type II;Respiratory failure, fatal",diabetes type ii;atrial flutter;hypotensive;Type 1 respiratory failure,Hypotension NEC;atrial flutter;Chronic respiratory failure;Pulmonary Heart Disease;Diabetes Type II,respiratory failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; hypotension; atrial flutter previously now status post ablation and in sinus rhythm ; diabetes type ii,"['respiratory failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'hypotension', 'atrial flutter previously now status post ablation and in sinus rhythm', 'diabetes type ii']",True,Yes

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 86 year old female with PMH of
   uncontrolled DM who presented with one day of LLQ discomfort, n/v/AMS,
   now with hypotension and likely urosepsis. CT showed multiseptated
   cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas - which is suggestive of
   serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN.  Mild left ureteral enhancement
   was also seen with surrounding inflammatory change that may represent
   ureteritis. Patient continuing to require some pressor support but is
   otherwise stable.",Sepsis: Likely urinary source given CT findings and positive UA; Hypotension: In the setting of infection/sepsis.; # Acute renal failure:; # Pancreatic Mass; Transaminitis; Type II DM:,"Sepsis
- The final CT abd/pelvis showd a multiseptated cystic lesion in the
tail of the pancreas, given appearance without associated duct dilation
would favor serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN.  recommend
comparison with priors if available or endoscopic ultrasound.  Tumor
markers were ordered for the am.
- CT also showed mild left uretral enhancement with surrounding
inflammatory change, which could represent ureteritis. Recommend
followup ureteroscopy after appropriate treatement
- The patient continued to require levophed, it was weaned down,
however her SBPs were in the 80's.  She briefly responded to a 500 cc
bolus of fluid, however she looked volume overloaded, so her levophed
was increased instead of more fluids for pressure support.
- Repeat lactates were down from 3.6 --> 2.0 --> 1.0.
- VBG checked and was 7.30/48/41/25 in the am; repeat in the evening
was 7.33/43/41/24

IMAGING:
[**2148-11-29**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
akinesis. There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF <20%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, as
well as a conduction abnormality or RV apical pacing. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
underestimated given severity of TR. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global
systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior myocardial
infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel CAD). Markedly
dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. Mild
aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Depressed cardiac index and at least mild pulmonary hypertension.
CXR: ETT balloon hyperinflated. Low lung volumes, with possible mild
vascular congestion. Moderate cardiomegaly.

TEE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.

potentially be present, although very difficult to evaluate, currently
with
such a significant amount of pulmonary edema obscuring most of the lung

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the mid-segment. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The aortic valve leaflets
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2151-3-13**] RENAL ULTRASOUND:
1. No hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass lesion. Renal
parenchyma
is normal in appearance.
2. Doppler interrogation of the kidneys demonstrates normal velocities
in the
main renal arteries. Resistive indices are within normal limits in the
interlobar arteries, though there are characteristic tarud/parvus
waveforms,
suggesting possible renal artery stenosis or fibromuscular dyhsplasia.
Further evaluation with MRI should be considered.

TTE:  CONCLUSIONS: Normal biventricular cavity size with preserved
biventricular systolic function. No valvular vegetations or masses
identified. If clinical suspicion of endocarditis is high, a TEE could
help to clarify.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-15**], the
degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased. The other findings are
similar.

Imaging: Echo [**3-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with distal inferoseptum, inferior wall
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-3-15**], the
region of hypokinesis in the distal inferoseptum has decreased.

Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. However, due to extensive acoustic artifact from the right heart wire/catheter, the amount of tricuspid regurgitation may be inaccurately quantitated by color-flow imaging. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
